  abstract = {In the Transformer model, “self-attention” combines information from attended embeddings into the representation of the focal embedding in the next layer. Thus, across layers of the Transformer, information originating from different tokens gets increasingly mixed. This makes attention weights unreliable as explanations probes. In this paper, we consider the problem of quantifying this flow of information through self-attention. We propose two methods for approximating the attention to input tokens given attention weights, attention rollout and attention flow, as post hoc methods when we use attention weights as the relative relevance of the input tokens. We show that these methods give complementary views on the flow of information, and compared to raw attention, both yield higher correlations with importance scores of input tokens obtained using an ablation method and input gradients.},

  abstract = {Diabetes is a condition of increase in the blood sugar level higher than the normal range. Prolonged diabetes damages the small blood vessels in the retina resulting in diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR progresses with time without any noticeable symptoms until the damage has occurred. Hence, it is very beneficial to have the regular cost effective eye screening for the diabetes subjects. This paper documents a system that can be used for automatic mass screenings of diabetic retinopathy. Four classes are identified: normal retina, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and macular edema (ME). We used 238 retinal fundus images in our analysis. Five different texture features such as homogeneity, correlation, short run emphasis, long run emphasis, and run percentage were extracted from the digital fundus images. These features were fed into a support vector machine classifier (SVM) for automatic classification. SVM classifier of different kernel functions (linear, radial basis function, polynomial of order 1, 2, and 3) was studied. Receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted to select the best classifier. Our proposed system is able to identify the unknown class with an accuracy of 85.2\%, and sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of 98.9\%, 89.5\%, and 0.972 respectively using SVM classifier with polynomial kernel of order 3. We have also proposed a new integrated DR index (IDRI) using different features, which is able to identify the different classes with 100\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a condition where the retina is damaged due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels into the retina. In extreme cases, the patient will become blind. Therefore, early detection of diabetic retinopathy is crucial to prevent blindness. Various image processing techniques have been used to identify the different stages of diabetes retinopathy. The application of non-linear features of the higher-order spectra (HOS) was found to be efficient as it is more suitable for the detection of shapes. The aim of this work is to automatically identify the normal, mild DR, moderate DR, severe DR and prolific DR. The parameters are extracted from the raw images using the HOS techniques and fed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This paper presents classification of five kinds of eye classes using SVM classifier. Our protocol uses, 300 subjects consisting of five different kinds of eye disease conditions. We demonstrate a sensitivity of 82\% for the classifier with the specificity of 88\%.},

  abstract = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the primary concerns due to its effect on vision loss among most people with diabetes globally. The severity of DR is mostly comprehended manually by ophthalmologists from fundus photography-based retina images. This paper deals with an automated understanding of the severity stages of DR. In the literature, researchers have focused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms and convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on essential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance. In this paper, we adopt transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial features of retinal images to understand DR severity better. We work with ensembling image transformers, where we adopt four models, namely ViT (Vision Transformer), BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation for image Transformer), CaiT (Class-Attention in Image Transformers), and DeiT (Data efficient image Transformers), to infer the degree of DR severity from fundus photographs. For experiments, we used the publicly available APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset, where the performances of the transformer-based models were quite encouraging.},

  abstract = {Saliency methods have emerged as a popular tool to highlight features in an input deemed relevant for the prediction of a learned model. Several saliency methods have been proposed, often guided by visual appeal on image data. In this work, we propose an actionable methodology to evaluate what kinds of explanations a given method can and cannot provide. We find that reliance, solely, on visual assessment can be misleading. Through extensive experiments we show that some existing saliency methods are independent both of the model and of the data generating process. Consequently, methods that fail the proposed tests are inadequate for tasks that are sensitive to either data or model, such as, finding outliers in the data, explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs that the model learned, and debugging the model. We interpret our findings through an analogy with edge detection in images, a technique that requires neither training data nor model. Theory in the case of a linear model and a single-layer convolutional neural network supports our experimental findings2.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has the potential to transform medical diagnostics. However, the diagnostic accuracy of DL is uncertain. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology in medical imaging. Searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 11,921 studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review. Eighty-two studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115 in respiratory disease were included for meta-analysis. Two hundred twenty-four studies in other specialities were included for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology using medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were measures of diagnostic accuracy, study design and reporting standards in the literature. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC’s ranged between 0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma on retinal fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. In respiratory imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing breast cancer on mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and digital breast tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between studies and extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome measures was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms on medical imaging. There is an immediate need for the development of artificial intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in order to provide guidance around key issues in this field.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) causes blindness in the working age for people with diabetes in most countries. The increasing number of people with diabetes worldwide suggests that DR will continue to be major contributors to vision loss. Early detection of retinopathy progress in individuals with diabetes is critical for preventing visual loss. Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) is an early stage of DR. Moreover, NPDR can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. This paper proposes a novel morphology-based algorithm for detecting retinal lesions and classifying each case. First, the proposed algorithm detects the three DR lesions, namely haemorrhages, microaneurysms and exudates. Second, we defined and extracted a set of features from detected lesions. The set of selected feature emulates what physicians looked for in classifying NPDR case. Finally, we designed an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier with three layers to classify NPDR to normal, mild, moderate and severe. Bayesian regularisation and resilient backpropagation algorithms are used to train ANN. The accuracy for the proposed classifiers based on Bayesian regularisation and resilient backpropagation algorithms are 96.6 and 89.9, respectively. The obtained results are compared with results of the recent published classifier. Our proposed classifier outperforms the best in terms of sensitivity and specificity.},

Our method uses linear classifiers, referred to as "probes", where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given intermediate layer as discriminating features. Moreover, these probes cannot affect the training phase of a model, and they are generally added after training. They allow the user to visualize the state of the model at multiple steps of training.

  abstract = {In this paper we proposed a decomposition based approach, coupled with local feature extraction, to support the analysis of Three-Dimensional (3D) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images so as to determine the presence (or otherwise) of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in the retina of the human eye. AMD is one of the leading causes of vision loss in people aged over 50 years in the world. The 3D OCT imaging technique has become an indispensable diagnostic tool for the management of AMD. However, there is a lack of automated decision-making tools for analysing the large volumes of data that can be collected using OCT. In order to address this problem, a volumetric analysis technique is proposed for the automated diagnosis of AMD in 3D OCT images without the need for detecting AMD lesions. The process commences with the decomposition of a given image into sub-regions by recursively dividing a volume into sub-volumes. Then, for each sub-volume, oriented gradient local binary pattern histograms are extracted and formed into a feature vector to which classifier generation techniques can be applied. The proposed technique was evaluated using ten-fold cross validation by applying it to 140 volumetric OCT images, the results demonstrated a promising performance with a best Area Under the receiver operating Curve (AUC) value of 94.4\%.},

  abstract = {Studies have shown that diabetes costs over \$770 million in USA. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its complication diabetic macular edema (DME) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are crucial diseases that might affect the retina and lead to blindness. Optical Coherence Tomography screening is one of the most effective screening methods to diagnose the retinal cysts lesions and to view the retina in 3-D volumes. This paper presents a methodology for automated detection of retinal cysts on Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) volumes. The proposed method considers a generic classification pipeline that extracts the stable regions and then compares the stable regions with the optimal ground truth in order to label the potential regions. After that, the potential regions were resized and sent to the autoencoder to extract the features in an unsupervised fashion. Finally, the trained data was classified using the softmax layer in a supervised fashion, and the test data is passed through the network to validate the results. The results obtained from our pipeline are 93.0\% and 82.0\% for sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) respectively.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism.

This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the “Principles of Biomedical Ethics” by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.},

Blindness may appear as a result of unchecked and severe cases of diabetic retinopathy. Manual inspection of fundus images to check morphological changes in microaneurysms, exudates, blood vessels, hemorrhages, and macula is a very time-consuming and tedious work. It can be made easily with the help of computer-aided system and intervariability for the observer. In this paper, several techniques for detecting microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates are discussed for ultimate detection of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Blood vessels detection techniques are also discussed for the diagnosis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, the paper elaborates a discussion on the experiments accessed by authors for the detection of diabetic retinopathy. This work will be helpful for the researchers and technical persons who want to utilize the ongoing research in this area.},

  abstract = {We introduce Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), a method to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated. Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method canonical correlation analysis (CCA). It is an alternative to the nonparametric method kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when computing the representations of unseen instances. In experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward neural networks.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based algorithm for glaucoma diagnosis in patients with open-angle glaucoma, based on three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (OCT) data and color fundus images. In this study, 208 glaucomatous and 149 healthy eyes were enrolled, and color fundus images and volumetric OCT data from the optic disc and macular area of these eyes were captured with a spectral-domain OCT (3D OCT-2000, Topcon). Thickness and deviation maps were created with a segmentation algorithm. Transfer learning of convolutional neural network (CNN) was used with the following types of input images: (1) fundus image of optic disc in grayscale format, (2) disc retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness map, (3) macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness map, (4) disc RNFL deviation map, and (5) macular GCC deviation map. Data augmentation and dropout were performed to train the CNN. For combining the results from each CNN model, a random forest (RF) was trained to classify the disc fundus images of healthy and glaucomatous eyes using feature vector representation of each input image, removing the second fully connected layer. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of a 10-fold cross validation (CV) was used to evaluate the models. The 10-fold CV AUCs of the CNNs were 0.940 for color fundus images, 0.942 for RNFL thickness maps, 0.944 for macular GCC thickness maps, 0.949 for disc RNFL deviation maps, and 0.952 for macular GCC deviation maps. The RF combining the five separate CNN models improved the 10-fold CV AUC to 0.963. Therefore, the machine learning system described here can accurately differentiate between healthy and glaucomatous subjects based on their extracted images from OCT data and color fundus images. This system should help to improve the diagnostic accuracy in glaucoma.},

Here, we describe an algorithm to predict DR progression by means of deep learning (DL), using as input color fundus photographs (CFPs) acquired at a single visit from a patient with DR. The proposed DL models were designed to predict future DR progression, defined as 2-step worsening on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, and were trained against DR severity scores assessed after 6, 12, and 24 months from the baseline visit by masked, well-trained, human reading center graders. The performance of one of these models (prediction at month 12) resulted in an area under the curve equal to 0.79. Interestingly, our results highlight the importance of the predictive signal located in the peripheral retinal fields, not routinely collected for DR assessments, and the importance of microvascular abnormalities. Our findings show the feasibility of predicting future DR progression by leveraging CFPs of a patient acquired at a single visit. Upon further development on larger and more diverse datasets, such an algorithm could enable early diagnosis and referral to a retina specialist for more frequent monitoring and even consideration of early intervention. Moreover, it could also improve patient recruitment for clinical trials targeting DR.},

  abstract = {To develop deep learning (DL) models for the automatic detection of optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures of diabetic macular thickening (MT) from color fundus photographs (CFPs).    Retrospective analysis on 17,997 CFPs and their associated OCT measurements from the phase 3 RIDE/RISE diabetic macular edema (DME) studies. DL with transfer-learning cascade was applied on CFPs to predict time-domain OCT (TD-OCT)–equivalent measures of MT, including central subfield thickness (CST) and central foveal thickness (CFT). MT was defined by using two OCT cutoff points: 250 μm and 400 μm. A DL regression model was developed to directly quantify the actual CFT and CST from CFPs.    The best DL model was able to predict CST ≥ 250 μm and CFT ≥ 250 μm with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.89–1.00) and 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.76–0.99), respectively. To predict CST ≥ 400 μm and CFT ≥ 400 μm, the best DL model had an AUC of 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.82–1.00) and 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.88–1.00), respectively. The best deep convolutional neural network regression model to quantify CST and CFT had an R2 of 0.74 (95\% CI, 0.49–0.91) and 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.20–0.87), respectively. The performance of the DL models declined when the CFPs were of poor quality or contained laser scars.    DL is capable of predicting key quantitative TD-OCT measurements related to MT from CFPs. The DL models presented here could enhance the efficiency of DME diagnosis in tele-ophthalmology programs, promoting better visual outcomes. Future research is needed to validate DL algorithms for MT in the real-world.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to construct and evaluate a deep learning (DL) model to diagnose early glaucoma from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. DESIGN: Artificial intelligence diagnostic tool development, evaluation, and comparison. METHODS: This multi-institution study included pretraining data of 4316 OCT images (RS3000) from 1371 eyes with open angle glaucoma (OAG) regardless of the stage of glaucoma and 193 normal eyes. Training data included OCT-1000/2000 images from 94 eyes of 94 patients with early OAG (mean deviation {$>~$}-5.0 dB) and 84 eyes of 84 normal subjects. Testing data included OCT-1000/2000 from 114 eyes of 114 patients with early OAG (mean deviation {$>~$}-5.0 dB) and 82 eyes of 82 normal subjects. A DL (convolutional neural network) classifier was trained using a pretraining dataset, followed by a second round of training using an independent training dataset. The DL model input features were the 8~× 8 grid macular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell complex layer thickness from spectral-domain OCT. Diagnostic accuracy was investigated in the testing dataset. For comparison, diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated using the random forests and support vector machine models. The primary outcome measure was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC). RESULTS: The AROC with the DL model was 93.7\%. The AROC significantly decreased to between 76.6\% and 78.8\% without the pretraining process. Significantly smaller AROCs were obtained with random forests and support vector machine models (82.0\% and 67.4\%, respectively). CONCLUSION: A DL model for glaucoma using spectral-domain OCT offers a substantive increase in diagnostic performance.},

  abstract = {This study examines how characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs) that are explicitly resolved in a global atmospheric model with horizontal resolution of approximately 28 km are projected to change in a warmer climate using bias-corrected sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). The impact of mitigating from RCP8.5 to RCP4.5 is explicitly considered and is compared with uncertainties arising from SST projections. We find a reduction in overall global TC activity as climate warms. This reduction is somewhat less pronounced under RCP4.5 than under RCP8.5. By contrast, the frequency of very intense TCs is projected to increase dramatically in a warmer climate, with most of the increase concentrated in the NW Pacific basin. Extremes of storm related precipitation are also projected to become more common. Reduction in the frequency of extreme precipitation events is possible through mitigation from RCP8.5 to RCP4.5. In general more detailed basin-scale projections of future TC activity are subject to large uncertainties due to uncertainties in future SSTs. In most cases these uncertainties are larger than the effects of mitigating from RCP8.5 to RCP4.5.},

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

  abstract = {The interest in machine learning (ML) has grown tremendously in recent years, partly due to the performance leap that occurred with new techniques of deep learning, convolutional neural networks for images, increased computational power, and wider availability of large datasets. Most fields of medicine follow that popular trend and, notably, radiation oncology is one of those that are at the forefront, with already a long tradition in using digital images and fully computerized workflows. ML models are driven by data, and in contrast with many statistical or physical models, they can be very large and complex, with countless generic parameters. This inevitably raises two questions, namely, the tight dependence between the models and the datasets that feed them, and the interpretability of the models, which scales with its complexity. Any problems in the data used to train the model will be later reflected in their performance. This, together with the low interpretability of ML models, makes their implementation into the clinical workflow particularly difficult. Building tools for risk assessment and quality assurance of ML models must involve then two main points: interpretability and data-model dependency. After a joint introduction of both radiation oncology and ML, this paper reviews the main risks and current solutions when applying the latter to workflows in the former. Risks associated with data and models, as well as their interaction, are detailed. Next, the core concepts of interpretability, explainability, and data-model dependency are formally defined and illustrated with examples. Afterwards, a broad discussion goes through key applications of ML in workflows of radiation oncology as well as vendors’ perspectives for the clinical implementation of ML.},

  abstract = {• We review concepts related to the explainability of AI methods (XAI). • We comprehensive analyze the XAI literature organized in two taxonomies. • We identify future research directions of the XAI field. • We discuss potential implications of XAI and privacy in data fusion contexts. • We identify Responsible AI as a concept promoting XAI and other AI principles in practical settings. In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

  abstract = {Sample complexity results from computational learning theory, when applied to neural network learning for pattern classification problems, suggest that for good generalization performance the number of training examples should grow at least linearly with the number of adjustable parameters in the network. Results in this paper show that if a large neural network is used for a pattern classification problem and the learning algorithm finds a network with small weights that has small squared error on the training patterns, then the generalization performance depends on the size of the weights rather than the number of weights. For example, consider a two-layer feedforward network of sigmoid units, in which the sum of the magnitudes of the weights associated with each unit is bounded by A and the input dimension is n. We show that the misclassification probability is no more than a certain error estimate (that is related to squared error on the training set) plus A/sup 3/ /spl radic/((log n)/m) (ignoring log A and log m factors), where m is the number of training patterns. This may explain the generalization performance of neural networks, particularly when the number of training examples is considerably smaller than the number of weights. It also supports heuristics (such as weight decay and early stopping) that attempt to keep the weights small during training. The proof techniques appear to be useful for the analysis of other pattern classifiers: when the input domain is a totally bounded metric space, we use the same approach to give upper bounds on misclassification probability for classifiers with decision boundaries that are far from the training examples.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities to improve private and public life. Discovering patterns and structures in large troves of data in an automated manner is a core component of data science, and currently drives applications in diverse areas such as computational biology, law and finance. However, such a highly positive impact is coupled with a significant challenge: how do we understand the decisions suggested by these systems in order that we can trust them? In this report, we focus specifically on data-driven methods—machine learning (ML) and pattern recognition models in particular—so as to survey and distill the results and observations from the literature. The purpose of this report can be especially appreciated by noting that ML models are increasingly deployed in a wide range of businesses. However, with the increasing prevalence and complexity of methods, business stakeholders in the very least have a growing number of concerns about the drawbacks of models, data-specific biases, and so on. Analogously, data science practitioners are often not aware about approaches emerging from the academic literature or may struggle to appreciate the differences between different methods, so end up using industry standards such as SHAP. Here, we have undertaken a survey to help industry practitioners (but also data scientists more broadly) understand the field of explainable machine learning better and apply the right tools. Our latter sections build a narrative around a putative data scientist, and discuss how she might go about explaining her models by asking the right questions. From an organization viewpoint, after motivating the area broadly, we discuss the main developments, including the principles that allow us to study transparent models vs. opaque models, as well as model-specific or model-agnostic post-hoc explainability approaches. We also briefly reflect on deep learning models, and conclude with a discussion about future research directions.},

Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Although the usefulness of viewing the ocular fundus is well-recognized, ophthalmoscopy is infrequently and poorly performed by most nonophthalmologist physicians, including neurologists. Barriers to the practice of ophthalmoscopy by nonophthalmologists include not only the technical difficulty related to direct ophthalmoscopy, but also lack of adequate training and discouragement by preceptors. Recent studies have shown that digital retinal fundus photographs with electronic transmission and remote interpretation of images by an ophthalmologist are an efficient and reliable way to allow examination of the ocular fundus in patients with systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus. Ocular fundus photographs obtained without pharmacologic dilation of the pupil using nonmydriatic fundus cameras could be of great value in emergency departments (EDs) and neurologic settings. The Fundus Photography vs Ophthalmoscopy Trial Outcomes in the Emergency Department (FOTO-ED) study showed that ED providers consistently failed to correctly identify relevant ocular funduscopic findings using the direct ophthalmoscope, and that nonmydriatic fundus photography was an effective alternate way of providing access to the ocular fundus in the ED. Extrapolating these results to headache clinics, outpatient neurology clinics, and adult and pediatric primary care settings seems self-evident. As technology advances, nonmydriatic ocular fundus imaging systems will be of higher quality and more portable and affordable, thereby circumventing the need to master the use of the ophthalmoscope. Visualizing the ocular fundus is more important than the method used. Ocular fundus photography facilitates nonophthalmologists performance of this essential part of the physical examination, thus helping to reestablish the value of doing so.ACEP=American College of Emergency Physicians; ACGME=Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; CI=confidence interval; ED=emergency department; FOTO-ED=Fundus Photography vs Ophthalmoscopy Trial Outcomes in the Emergency Department; IIH=idiopathic intracranial hypertension},

The methods in this paper lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant’s results, along with previous results on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the VapnikChervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the classof concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classesare analyzed, and the necessary and sufftcient conditions are provided for feasible learnability.},

  abstract = {Glaucoma as a neurodegeneration of the optic nerve is one of the most common causes of blindness. Because revitalization of the degenerated nerve fibers of the optic nerve is impossible early detection of the disease is essential. This can be supported by a robust and automated mass-screening. We propose a novel automated glaucoma detection system that operates on inexpensive to acquire and widely used digital color fundus images. After a glaucoma specific preprocessing, different generic feature types are compressed by an appearance-based dimension reduction technique. Subsequently, a probabilistic two-stage classification scheme combines these features types to extract the novel Glaucoma Risk Index (GRI) that shows a reasonable glaucoma detection performance. On a sample set of 575 fundus images a classification accuracy of 80\% has been achieved in a 5-fold cross-validation setup. The GRI gains a competitive area under ROC (AUC) of 88\% compared to the established topography-based glaucoma probability score of scanning laser tomography with AUC of 87\%. The proposed color fundus image-based GRI achieves a competitive and reliable detection performance on a low-priced modality by the statistical analysis of entire images of the optic nerve head.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: During the first phase of the Fundus Photography vs Ophthalmoscopy Trial Outcomes in the Emergency Department study, 13\% (44/350; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 9\% to 17\%) of patients had an ocular fundus finding, such as papilledema, relevant to their emergency department (ED) management found by nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography reviewed by neuro-ophthalmologists. All of these findings were missed by emergency physicians, who examined only 14\% of enrolled patients by direct ophthalmoscopy. In the present study, we evaluate the sensitivity of nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography, an alternative to direct ophthalmoscopy, for relevant findings when photographs are made available for use by emergency physicians during routine clinical care. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-four patients presenting to our ED with headache, focal neurologic deficit, visual change, or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 120 mm Hg had nonmydriatic fundus photography obtained (Kowa nonmydriatic α-D). Photographs were placed on the electronic medical record for emergency physician review. Identification of relevant findings on photographs by emergency physicians was compared with a reference standard of neuro-ophthalmologist review. RESULTS: Emergency physicians reviewed photographs of 239 patients (68\%). Thirty-five patients (10\%; 95\% CI 7\% to 13\%) had relevant findings identified by neuro-ophthalmologist review (6 disc edema, 6 grade III/IV hypertensive retinopathy, 7 isolated hemorrhages, 15 optic disc pallor, and 1 retinal vascular occlusion). Emergency physicians identified 16 of 35 relevant findings (sensitivity 46\%; 95\% CI 29\% to 63\%) and also identified 289 of 319 normal findings (specificity 91\%; 95\% CI 87\% to 94\%). Emergency physicians reported that photographs were helpful for 125 patients (35\%). CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians used nonmydriatic fundus photographs more frequently than they performed direct ophthalmoscopy, and their detection of relevant abnormalities improved. Ocular fundus photography often assisted ED care even when results were normal. Nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography offers a promising alternative to direct ophthalmoscopy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Examination of the ocular fundus is imperative in many acute medical and neurologic conditions, but direct ophthalmoscopy by nonophthalmologists is underutilized, poorly performed, and difficult without pharmacologic pupillary dilation. The objective was to examine the feasibility of nonmydriatic fundus photography as a clinical alternative to direct ophthalmoscopy by emergency physicians (EPs). METHODS: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with headache, acute focal neurologic deficit, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg, or acute visual change had ocular fundus photographs taken by nurse practitioners using a nonmydriatic fundus camera. Photographs were reviewed by a neuroophthalmologist within 24 hours for findings relevant to acute ED patient care. Nurse practitioners and patients rated ease, comfort, and speed of nonmydriatic fundus photography on a 10-point Likert scale (10 best). Timing of visit and photography were recorded by automated electronic systems. RESULTS: A total of 350 patients were enrolled. There were 1,734 photographs taken during 230 nurse practitioner shifts. Eighty-three percent of the 350 patients had at least one eye with a high-quality photograph, while only 3\% of patients had no photographs of diagnostic value. Mean ratings were ≥ 8.7 (standard deviation [SD] ≤ 1.9) for all measures. The median photography session lasted 1.9 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.3 to 2.9 minutes), typically accounting for less that 0.5\% of the patient's total ED visit. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmydriatic fundus photography taken by nurse practitioners is a feasible alternative to direct ophthalmoscopy in the ED. It is performed well by nonphysician staff, is well-received by staff and patients, and requires a trivial amount of time to perform.},

In this paper we consider possible generalizations of CNNs to signals defined on more general domains without the action of a translation group. In particular, we propose two constructions, one based upon a hierarchical clustering of the domain, and another based on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We show through experiments that for lowdimensional graphs it is possible to learn convolutional layers with a number of parameters independent of the input size, resulting in efficient deep architectures.},

However, the exact minimum width, wmin, for the UAP has not been studied thoroughly. Recently, using a decoder-memorizer-encoder scheme, Park et al.

In this paper, we consider neural networks with an arbitrary set of activation functions. We prove that both C-UAP and Lp-UAP for functions on compact domains share a universal lower bound of the minimal width; that is, wm∗ in = max(dx, dy). In particular, the critical width, wm∗ in, for Lp-UAP can be achieved by leaky-ReLU networks, provided that the input or output dimension is larger than one. Our construction is based on the approximation power of neural ordinary differential equations and the ability to approximate flow maps by neural networks. The nonmonotone or discontinuous activation functions case and the one-dimensional case are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in many vision tasks. However, ViT is inferior to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when targeting high-resolution mobile vision applications. The key computational bottleneck of ViT is the softmax attention module which has quadratic computational complexity with the input resolution. It is essential to reduce the cost of ViT to deploy it on edge devices. Existing methods (e.g., Swin, PVT) restrict the softmax attention within local windows or reduce the resolution of key/value tensors to reduce the cost, which sacrifices ViT’s core advantages on global feature extractions. In this work, we present EfficientViT, an efficient ViT architecture for high-resolution low-computation visual recognition. Instead of restricting the softmax attention, we propose to replace softmax attention with linear attention while enhancing its local feature extraction ability with depthwise convolution. EfficientViT maintains global and local feature extraction capability while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments on COCO object detection and Cityscapes semantic segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On the COCO dataset, EfficientViT achieves 42.6 AP with 4.4G MACs, surpassing EfficientDet-D1 by 2.4 AP while having 27.9\% fewer MACs. On Cityscapes, EfficientViT reaches 78.7 mIoU with 19.1G MACs, outperforming SegFormer by 2.5 mIoU while requiring less than 1/3 the computational cost. On Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU, EfficientViT is 3× faster than EfficientNet while achieving higher ImageNet accuracy.},

  abstract = {Non-rigid inter-modality registration can facilitate accurate information fusion from different modalities, but it is challenging due to the very different image appearances across modalities. In this paper, we propose to train a non-rigid inter-modality image registration network, which can directly predict the transformation field from the input multimodal images, such as CT and MR images. In particular, the training of our inter-modality registration network is supervised by intra-modality similarity metric based on the available paired data, which is derived from a pre-aligned CT and MR dataset. Specifically, in the training stage, to register the input CT and MR images, their similarity is evaluated on the warped MR image and the MR image that is paired with the input CT. So that, the intra-modality similarity metric can be directly applied to measure whether the input CT and MR images are well registered. Moreover, we use the idea of dual-modality fashion, in which we measure the similarity on both CT modality and MR modality. In this way, the complementary anatomies in both modalities can be jointly considered to more accurately train the inter-modality registration network. In the testing stage, the trained inter-modality registration network can be directly applied to register the new multimodal images without any paired data. Experimental results have shown that, the proposed method can achieve promising accuracy and efficiency for the challenging non-rigid inter-modality registration task and also outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This work proposes creating an automatic system to locate and segment the optic nerve head (ONH) in eye fundus photographic images using genetic algorithms. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Domain knowledge is used to create a set of heuristics that guide the various steps involved in the process. Initially, using an eye fundus colour image as input, a set of hypothesis points was obtained that exhibited geometric properties and intensity levels similar to the ONH contour pixels. Next, a genetic algorithm was used to find an ellipse containing the maximum number of hypothesis points in an offset of its perimeter, considering some constraints. The ellipse thus obtained is the approximation to the ONH. The segmentation method is tested in a sample of 110 eye fundus images, belonging to 55 patients with glaucoma (23.1\%) and eye hypertension (76.9\%) and random selected from an eye fundus image base belonging to the Ophthalmology Service at Miguel Servet Hospital, Saragossa (Spain). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained are competitive with those in the literature. The method's generalization capability is reinforced when it is applied to a different image base from the one used in our study and a discrepancy curve is obtained very similar to the one obtained in our image base. In addition, the robustness of the method proposed can be seen in the high percentage of images obtained with a discrepancy delta{$<$}5 (96\% and 99\% in our and a different image base, respectively). The results also confirm the hypothesis that the ONH contour can be properly approached with a non-deformable ellipse. Another important aspect of the method is that it directly provides the parameters characterising the shape of the papilla: lengths of its major and minor axes, its centre of location and its orientation with regard to the horizontal position.},

  abstract = {Interpretable staged transfer learning (iSTL), a pipeline for improving image classification with small sample sizes, was trained to carry out classification of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Model attention was visualised using SHAP maps, allowing interpretation of its behaviour.    A disease classification task using the Inception-v4 convolutional neural network architecture and iSTL training pipeline was carried out. Target OCT images are available under licence (Gholami et al). Normal (n=206), macular hole (MH: n=104), diabetic retinopathy (DR; n=109), and central serous retinopathy (CSR; n=104) scans were used. 50 images were used for data augmentation and training, the remainder were used for validation. The model was pre-trained on ImageNet, given randomly initialised output layers; the early layers frozen. The model was then trained on an intermediate bridge dataset (Kermany et al), output layers replaced, and final training carried out on the target dataset. 10 models were trained, the best performing selected for SHAP attention maps visualisation.    SHAP maps showed both image and disease specific features were allocated importance during prediction. High importance areas have a large impact on the model’s prediction, low importance areas have less impact. Classifying CSR, high importance was allocated to areas surrounding posterior epithelial detachment and not to areas of subretinal fluid. With DR, retinal microaneurysms and intraretinal oedema were highlighted but subretinal fluid was not. MH scans saw strong regional importance allocated to the vertical edge of full-thickness holes and surrounding intraretinal cysts when present. Normal images typically presented with medium to high importance on the retinal pigment epithelium adjacent to the macula as well as the inner limiting membrane surface. Many images saw moderate attention within areas of the choroid and vitreous that had no apparent clinical importance. When present in the scan field the optic nerve head was not allocated high importance.    Confounding factors are a concern when training deep learning models, particularly with small datasets. The iSTL model appeared to predominantly use clinically applicable features to make predictions. Further work is needed to determine whether some features used to make predictions are confounds or genuine clinical features related to disease biomarkers.

  abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or `atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed “DeepLab” system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

Despite training on low-resolution ImageNet without labels, we find that a GPT-2 scale model learns strong image representations as measured by linear probing, fine-tuning, and low-data classification. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 96.3\% accuracy with a linear probe, outperforming a supervised Wide ResNet, and 99.0\% accuracy with full finetuning, matching the top supervised pre-trained models. An even larger model trained on a mixture of ImageNet and web images is competitive with self-supervised benchmarks on ImageNet, achieving 72.0\% top-1 accuracy on a linear probe of our features.},

To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed ‘DeepLabv3’ system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.},

  abstract = {Deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods have an intrinsic limitation that training a model requires a large amount of data with pixel-level annotations. To address this challenging issue, many researchers give attention to unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Unsupervised domain adaptation seeks to adapt the model trained on the source domain to the target domain. In this paper, we introduce a self-ensembling technique, one of the successful methods for domain adaptation in classification. However, applying self-ensembling to semantic segmentation is very difficult because heavily-tuned manual data augmentation used in self-ensembling is not useful to reduce the large domain gap in the semantic segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework consisting of two components, which are complementary to each other. First, we present a data augmentation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is computationally efficient and effective to facilitate domain alignment. Given those augmented images, we apply self-ensembling to enhance the performance of the segmentation network on the target domain. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.},

This study proposes real-time models for the detection of surgical instruments during laparoscopic surgery by using a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). A dataset included information of the 7 surgical tools is used for learning CNN. To track surgical instruments in real time, unified architecture of YOLO apply to the models.

In this paper, we propose a decision system to classify DM fundus images into normal, clinically significant macular edema (CMSE), and non-clinically significant macular edema (non-CMSE) classes. The objective of the proposed decision system is three fold namely, to automatically extract textural features (both region specific and global), to effectively choose subset of discriminatory features, and to classify DM fundus images to their corresponding class of disease severity. The system uses a gamut of textural features and an ensemble classifier derived from four popular classifiers such as the hidden naïve Bayes, naïve Bayes, sequential minimal optimization (SMO), and the tree-based J48 classifiers. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 96.7\% using five-fold cross validation.},

So far, research efforts have concentrated mainly on the accurate localization of the large to medium diameter vessels. However, failure to detect the smallest vessels at the segmentation step can lead to false positive lesion detection counts in a subsequent lesion analysis stage. In this study, a new hybrid method for the segmentation of the smallest vessels is proposed. Line detection and perceptual organization techniques are combined in a multi-scale scheme. Small vessels are reconstructed from the perceptual-based approach via tracking and pixel painting. The segmentation was validated in a high resolution fundus image database including healthy and diabetic subjects using pixel-based as well as perceptual-based measures. The proposed method achieves 85.06\% sensitivity rate, while the original multi-scale line detection method achieves 81.06\% sensitivity rate for the corresponding images (p{$<$}0.05). The improvement in the sensitivity rate for the database is 6.47\% when only the smallest vessels are considered (p{$<$}0.05). For the perceptual-based measure, the proposed method improves the detection of the vasculature by 7.8\% against the original multi-scale line detection method (p{$<$}0.05).},

It has been argued that simultaneous agreement among all raters could provide an alternative basis for measuring multiple-rater agreement; however, agreement among raters can actually be considered to be an arbitrary choice along a continuum ranging from agreement for a pair of raters to agreement among all raters.

However, retinal image processing presents pertinent obstacles such as the struggle of large-scale data acquisition and high cost of annotation. To address this, we have developed a data-efficient semisupervised generative adversarial network based classifier for automated diagnosis with limited labeled data. The framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The adversarial learning between them assists in building a generalizable classifier to predict progressive retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Experimental results on clinical-grade OCT images show an overall improvement of more than 10\% in accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper presents an automatic approach for A/V classification based on the analysis of a graph extracted from the retinal vasculature. The proposed method classifies the entire vascular tree deciding on the type of each intersection point (graph nodes) and assigning one of two labels to each vessel segment (graph links). Final classification of a vessel segment as A/V is performed through the combination of the graph-based labeling results with a set of intensity features. The results of this proposed method are compared with manual labeling for three public databases. Accuracy values of 88.3\%, 87.4\%, and 89.8\% are obtained for the images of the INSPIRE-AVR, DRIVE, and VICAVR databases, respectively. These results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches for A/V classification.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a fundus photographic severity scale for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: In the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, stereoscopic color fundus photographs were taken at baseline, at the 2-year follow-up visit, and annually thereafter. Photographs were graded for drusen characteristics (size, type, area), pigmentary abnormalities (increased pigment, depigmentation, geographic atrophy), and presence of abnormalities characteristic of neovascular AMD (retinal pigment epithelial detachment, serous or hemorrhagic sensory retinal detachment, subretinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhage, subretinal fibrous tissue). Advanced AMD was defined as presence of 1 or more neovascular AMD abnormalities, photocoagulation for AMD, or geographic atrophy involving the center of the macula. We explored associations among right eyes of 3212 participants between severity of drusen characteristics and pigmentary abnormalities at baseline and development of advanced AMD within 5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: A 9-step severity scale that combines a 6-step drusen area scale with a 5-step pigmentary abnormality scale was developed, on which the 5-year risk of advanced AMD increased progressively from less than 1\% in step 1 to about 50\% in step 9. Among the 334 eyes that had at least a 3-step progression on the scale between the baseline and 5-year visits, almost half showed stepwise progression through intervening severity levels at intervening visits. Replicate gradings showed agreement within 1 step on the scale in 87\% of eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The scale provides convenient risk categories and has acceptable reproducibility. Progression along it may prove to be useful as a surrogate for progression to advanced AMD.},

  abstract = {In diabetic retinopathy (DR), macular involvement can present as either macular edema or ischemia. Fluorescein angiography remains the gold standard in the evaluation of retinal vascular perfusion and diagnosis of macular ischemia. However, it is a costly, time-consuming technique, it requires venipuncture, and reports of anaphylaxis and death related to fluorescein injections have been documented, despite their rarity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides a fast and non-invasive method to assess retinal structures at a microscopic level. OCT angiography permits the noninvasive study of retinal and choroid circulation via motion contrast imaging. Split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography combined with OCT angiography has furthered the understanding of retinal and choroidal vascular diseases, allowing the evaluation of retinal microvasculature and identification of subsequent disorders, including DR. Previous studies using OCT angiography have demonstrated that it may demonstrate DR findings such as microaneurysms, arteriolar wall staining, retinal neovascularization, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. The purpose of this article is to describe and discuss different concepts regarding OCT angiography, as well as its role in the diagnosis of DR and maculopathy.},

Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500–1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

  abstract = {Scene understanding of high resolution aerial images is of great importance for the task of automated monitoring in various remote sensing applications. Due to the large within-class and small between-class variance in pixel values of objects of interest, this remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have started being used in remote sensing applications and demonstrate state of the art performance for pixel level classification of objects. Here we propose a reliable framework for performant results for the task of semantic segmentation of monotemporal very high resolution aerial images. Our framework consists of a novel deep learning architecture, ResUNet-a, and a novel loss function based on the Dice loss. ResUNet-a uses a UNet encoder/decoder backbone, in combination with residual connections, atrous convolutions, pyramid scene parsing pooling and multi-tasking inference. ResUNet-a infers sequentially the boundary of the objects, the distance transform of the segmentation mask, the segmentation mask and a colored reconstruction of the input. Each of the tasks is conditioned on the inference of the previous ones, thus establishing a conditioned relationship between the various tasks, as this is described through the architecture’s computation graph. We analyse the performance of several flavours of the Generalized Dice loss for semantic segmentation, and we introduce a novel variant loss function for semantic segmentation of objects that has excellent convergence properties and behaves well even under the presence of highly imbalanced classes. The performance of our modeling framework is evaluated on the ISPRS 2D Potsdam dataset. Results show state-of-the-art performance with an average F1 score of 92.9\% over all classes for our best model.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review To present, summarize and interpret most recent advances in the study and understanding of the lamina cribrosa (LC) in glaucoma, in the context of previous work. Recent Findings The lamina is an active living structure that responds to strain and changes morphology at the micro- and macro-scales in glaucoma. Changes in LC morphology in glaucoma include posteriorization of the laminar insertion into the sclera, increased cupping or depth of the LC, and the development of focal LC defects. These LC changes are associated with disk hemorrhages and visual field damage, and are detectable with clinical imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). Glaucomatous changes in the LC are driven by cellular processes mediated by focal cyclical mechanical strain. Strain is eye specific and mediated by IOP, cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), and scleral and LC morphology and structural stiffness; deleterious LC strains can occur at all levels of mean IOP. Summary Laminar morphology is ever changing in health and disease, and recent studies have identified several promising morphological changes that are indicative of glaucoma susceptibility, onset and progression.},

  abstract = {Retinal fundus photographs are employed as standard diagnostic tools in ophthalmology. Serial photographs of the flow of fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) dye are used to determine the areas of the retinal lesions. For objective measurements of features, the registration of the images is a necessity. In this paper, we employ optimization techniques for registration with the help of 2-parameter translational motion model of retinal angiograms, based on non-linear pre-processing (Wiener filtering and morphological gradient) and computation of the similarity criteria for the alignment of the two gradient images for any given rigid transformation. The optimization methods are effectively employed to minimize the similarity criterion. The presence of noise, the variations in the background and the temporal variation of the fluorescence level pose serious problems in obtaining a robust registration of the retinal images. Moreover, local search strategies are not robust in the case of ICG angiograms, even if one uses a multiresolution approach. The present work makes a systematic comparison of different optimization techniques, namely the minimization method derived from the optical flow formulation, the Nelder-Mead local search and the HCIAC ant colony metaheuristic, each optimizing a similarity criterion for the gradient images. The impact of the resolution and median filtering of gradient image is studied and the robustness of the approaches is tested through experimental studies, performed on macular fluorescein and ICG angiographies. Our proposed optimization techniques have shown interesting results especially for high resolution difficult registration problems. Moreover, this approach seems promising for affine (6-parameter motion model) or elastical registrations.},

  abstract = {OCT functions as a type of optical biopsy, providing information on retinal pathology in situ and in real time, with resolutions approaching that of excisional biopsy and histopathology. The development of ultrabroad-bandwidth and tunable light sources, as well as high-speed Fourier detection techniques, has enabled a significant improvement in ophthalmic optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging performance. Three-dimensional, ultrahigh-resolution OCT (UHR OCT) can provide information on intraretinal morphology that is not available from any other non-invasive diagnostic. High-speed imaging facilitates the acquisition of three-dimensional data sets (3D-OCT), thus enabling volumetric rendering and the generation of OCT fundus images that precisely and reproducibly register OCT images to fundus features. The development of broadband light sources emitting at new wavelengths, e.g., ∼1050nm, has enabled not only 3D-OCT imaging with enhanced choroidal visualization, but also reduced scattering losses and improved OCT performance in cataract patients. Adaptive optics using high-stroke, deformable mirror technology to correct higher order aberrations in the human eye, in combination with specially designed optics to compensate chromatic aberration along with three-dimensional UHR OCT, has recently enabled in vivo cellular-resolution retinal imaging. In addition, extensions of OCT have been developed to enhance image contrast and to enable non-invasive depth-resolved functional imaging of the retina, thus providing blood flow, spectroscopic, polarization-sensitive and physiological information. Functional OCT promises to enable the differentiation of retinal pathologies via localized, functional retinal response or metabolic properties. These advances promise to have a powerful impact on fundamental as well as clinical studies.},

A sensitivity of ∼80 dB is reached at a 1-image/s acquisition rate, which allows tomography in scattering media such as biological tissues.},

  abstract = {We have developed a white-light interference microscope for ultrahigh-resolution full-field optical coherence tomography of biological media. The experimental setup is based on a Linnik-type interferometer illuminated by a tungsten halogen lamp. En face tomographic images are calculated by a combination of interferometric images recorded by a high-speed CCD camera. Spatial resolution of 1.8 μm × 0.9 μm (transverse × axial) is achieved owing to the extremely short coherence length of the source, the compensation of dispersion mismatch in the interferometer arms, and the use of relatively high-numerical-aperture microscope objectives. A shot-noise-limited detection sensitivity of 90 dB is obtained in an acquisition time per image of 4 s. Subcellular-level images of plant, animal, and human tissues are presented.},

The 3711 patients enrolled in the ETDRS were assigned randomly to either aspirin (650 mg per day) or placebo. One eye of each patient was assigned randomly to early argon laser photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation. Both eyes were to be examined at least every 4 months and photocoagulation was to be initiated in eyes assigned to deferral as soon as high-risk proliferative retinopathy was detected. Examination of a large number of baseline ocular and patient characteristics indicated that there were no important differences between randomized treatment groups at baseline.},

  abstract = {Purpose Detection (diagnosis) of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for patients with type 2 diabetes, but almost clinically normal retina appearances. Methods The proposed computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system detects the DR in three steps: (a) localizing and segmenting 12 distinct retinal layers on the OCT image; (b) deriving features of the segmented layers, and (c) learning most discriminative features and classifying each subject as normal or diabetic. To localise and segment the retinal layers, signals (intensities) of the OCT image are described with a joint Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) model of intensities and shape descriptors. Each segmented layer is characterized with cumulative probability distribution functions (CDF) of its locally extracted features, such as reflectivity, curvature, and thickness. A multistage deep fusion classification network (DFCN) with a stack of non-negativity-constrained autoencoders (NCAE) is trained to select the most discriminative retinal layers’ features and use their CDFs for detecting the DR. A training atlas was built using the OCT scans for 12 normal subjects and their maps of layers hand-drawn by retina experts. Results Preliminary experiments on 52 clinical OCT scans (26 normal and 26 with early-stage DR, balanced between 40–79 yr old males and females; 40 training and 12 test subjects) gave the DR detection accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92\%; 83\%, and 100\%, respectively. The 100\% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity have been obtained in the leave-one-out cross-validation test for all the 52 subjects. Conclusion Both the quantitative and visual assessments confirmed the high accuracy of the proposed computer-assisted diagnostic system for early DR detection using the OCT retinal images.},

In the paper, an automatic scheme to register retinal images based on blood vessel feature point extraction is presented. Firstly, the crossover and branching points of the RF (red-free) retinal image and the FA (fluoroscein angiography) retinal image are extracted using a multi-direction exploratory method after the blood vessel visibility is enhanced. Considering the number of feature points extracted on different images are not equal and their location does not correspond between the retinal images, the scheme described in the paper combined the closest interval criterion between the corresponding feature points with a SVD algorithm to accurately register retinal images. Our method compared with previously known ways is an efficient and automatic scheme of retinal image registration. The experimental results indicate the registration of the fluoroscein angiography image with the corresponding red-free retinal image and a series of the fluoroscein angiography images can be also successful using our method.},

  abstract = {Automatic and accurate classification of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is essential to assist ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and grading of macular diseases. Clinically, ophthalmologists usually diagnose macular diseases according to the structures of macular lesions, whose morphologies, size, and numbers are important criteria. In this paper, we propose a novel lesion-aware convolutional neural network (LACNN) method for retinal OCT image classification, in which retinal lesions within OCT images are utilized to guide the CNN to achieve more accurate classification. The LACNN simulates the ophthalmologists’ diagnosis that focuses on local lesion-related regions when analyzing the OCT image. Specifically, we firstly design a lesion detection network (LDN) to generate a soft attention map from the whole OCT image. The attention map is then incorporated into a classification network to weight the contributions of local convolutional representations. Guided by the lesion attention map, the classification network can utilize the information from local lesion-related regions to further accelerate the network training process and improve the OCT classification. Our experimental results on two clinically acquired OCT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LACNN method for retinal OCT image classification.},

  abstract = {Automatic and accurate classification of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is essential to assist ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and grading of macular diseases. Clinically, ophthalmologists usually diagnose macular diseases according to the structures of macular lesions, whose morphologies, size, and numbers are important criteria. In this paper, we propose a novel lesion-aware convolutional neural network (LACNN) method for retinal OCT image classification, in which retinal lesions within OCT images are utilized to guide the CNN to achieve more accurate classification. The LACNN simulates the ophthalmologists' diagnosis that focuses on local lesion-related regions when analyzing the OCT image. Specifically, we first design a lesion detection network to generate a soft attention map from the whole OCT image. The attention map is then incorporated into a classification network to weight the contributions of local convolutional representations. Guided by the lesion attention map, the classification network can utilize the information from local lesion-related regions to further accelerate the network training process and improve the OCT classification. Our experimental results on two clinically acquired OCT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LACNN method for retinal OCT image classification.},

  abstract = {Scene labeling consists of labeling each pixel in an image with the category of the object it belongs to. We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape, and contextual information. We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford background dataset (eight classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320×240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define quantitative indicators for the presence of intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) via spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging of older adults. DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic test and technology. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: One eye from 115 elderly subjects without AMD and 269 subjects with intermediate AMD from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Ancillary SD-OCT Study. METHODS: We semiautomatically delineated the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and RPE drusen complex (RPEDC, the axial distance from the apex of the drusen and RPE layer to Bruch's membrane) and total retina (TR, the axial distance between the inner limiting and Bruch's membranes) boundaries. We registered and averaged the thickness maps from control subjects to generate a map of "normal" non-AMD thickness. We considered RPEDC thicknesses larger or smaller than 3 standard deviations from the mean as abnormal, indicating drusen or geographic atrophy (GA), respectively. We measured TR volumes, RPEDC volumes, and abnormal RPEDC thickening and thinning volumes for each subject. By using different combinations of these 4 disease indicators, we designed 5 automated classifiers for the presence of AMD on the basis of the generalized linear model regression framework. We trained and evaluated the performance of these classifiers using the leave-one-out method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The range and topographic distribution of the RPEDC and TR thicknesses in a 5-mm diameter cylinder centered at the fovea. RESULTS: The most efficient method for separating AMD and control eyes required all 4 disease indicators. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for this classifier was {$>$}0.99. Overall neurosensory retinal thickening in eyes with AMD versus control eyes in our study contrasts with previous smaller studies. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated efficient biometrics to distinguish AMD from normal eyes by analyzing the topographic distribution of normal and abnormal RPEDC thicknesses across a large atlas of eyes. We created an online atlas to share the 38\,400 SD-OCT images in this study, their corresponding segmentations, and quantitative measurements.},

  abstract = {The volume and complexity of diagnostic imaging is increasing at a pace faster than the availability of human expertise to interpret it. Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting.},

We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions.},

Calculation of retinal thickness and volume by the current optical coherence tomography (OCT) system includes fluid-filled regions or lesions along with actual retinal tissue. In order to quantify these lesions independently from the retinal tissue, they must be outlined. A deformable model was applied to OCT images of retinas demonstrating cystoids and subretinal fluid spaces. Several implementation issues were addressed in order to choose appropriate parameters. The use of a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion filter to suppress speckle noise while at the same time preserving the edges of the original image was explored. Once the contours of the lesions were outlined, quantitative analysis of the surface area and volume of the lesions was performed. The deformable model could accurately outline fluid-filled regions within the retina. The detection method tested proved effective in capturing the complexity of fluid-filled regions in OCT images. Deformable models combined with nonlinear anisotropic diffusion filtering show promise in the detection of retinal features of interest for diagnosis in clinical OCT images. Thus, fluid-filled region detection may significantly aid in analysis of treatments and diagnosis.},

In order to avoid overfitting, we propose to control the channel-wise connections between input and output by making use of grouped linear projections. In a number of transductive node-classification experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {We present Spline-based Convolutional Neural Networks (SplineCNNs), a variant of deep neural networks for irregular structured and geometric input, e.g., graphs or meshes. Our main contribution is a novel convolution operator based on B-splines, that makes the computation time independent from the kernel size due to the local support property of the B-spline basis functions. As a result, we obtain a generalization of the traditional CNN convolution operator by using continuous kernel functions parametrized by a fixed number of trainable weights. In contrast to related approaches that filter in the spectral domain, the proposed method aggregates features purely in the spatial domain. In addition, SplineCNN allows entire end-to-end training of deep architectures, using only the geometric structure as input, instead of handcrafted feature descriptors.},

Existing RIQA methods focus on the RGB color-space and are developed based on small datasets with binary quality labels (i.e., ‘Accept’ and ‘Reject’). In this paper, we first re-annotate an Eye-Quality (EyeQ) dataset with 28,792 retinal images from the EyePACS dataset, based on a three-level quality grading system (i.e., ‘Good’, ‘Usable’ and ‘Reject’) for evaluating RIQA methods. Our RIQA dataset is characterized by its large-scale size, multi-level grading, and multi-modality. Then, we analyze the influences on RIQA of different color-spaces, and propose a simple yet efficient deep network, named Multiple Color-space Fusion Network (MCF-Net), which integrates the different color-space representations at both a feature-level and prediction-level to predict image quality grades. Experiments on our EyeQ dataset show that our MCF-Net obtains a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the other deep learning methods. Furthermore, we also evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection methods on images of different quality, and demonstrate that the performances of automated diagnostic systems are highly dependent on image quality.},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

In this paper we take as initial point an ASS strategy based on clustering. We then improve its performance by solving issues related to instances located close to the cluster boundaries by enlarging their size and considering the use of Deep Neural Networks for learning a suitable representation for the classification task at issue. Results using a collection of eight different datasets show that the combined use of these two strategies entails a significant improvement in the accuracy performance, with a considerable reduction in the number of distances needed to classify a sample in comparison to the basic kNN rule.},

  abstract = {Importance Previous studies of the implications of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severity in one eye on prognosis for the fellow eye have focused on incidence of neovascular AMD in the fellow eye of subjects with neovascular AMD in the other eye. It is unclear to what extent AMD severity in one eye impacts incidence, progression, and regression of AMD in its fellow eye across the entire range of AMD severity. Objective To investigate the impact of severity of AMD in one eye on incidence, progression, and regression of AMD in the fellow eye. Design, Setting and Participants The Beaver Dam Eye Study, a longitudinal population-based study of age-related eye diseases conducted in the city and township of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period (1988-1990 through 2008-2010). Study participants (N=4379) were aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination. At baseline and up to 4 subsequent examinations, retinal photographs were taken. Exposures Age, sex, and the Y402H polymorphism in the Complement Factor H gene on chromosome 1q; AMD severity in the fellow eye. Main Outcome Measures Incidence, progression, and regression of AMD assessed in retinal photographs according to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System; mortality. Results More severe AMD in one eye was associated with increased incidence and progression of AMD in its fellow eye (Level 1 to 2: hazard ratio [HR] 4.90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.26-5.63; Level 2 to 3: HR 2.09, CI 1.42-3.06; Level 3 to 4: HR 2.38, CI 1.74-3.25; Level 4 to Level 5: HR 2.46, CI 1.65-3.66). Less severe AMD in one eye was associated with less progression of AMD in its fellow eye (Level 2 to 3: HR 0.42, CI 0.33-0.55; Level 3 to 4: HR 0.50, CI 0.34-0.83). We estimate that 51\% of subjects who develop any AMD always maintain AMD severity states within 1 step of each other between eyes; 90\% stay within 2 steps. Conclusions and Relevance Using multi-state models, we show that AMD severity in one eye tracks AMD severity in its fellow eye.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Convolutional neural networks can naturally operate on images, but have significant challenges in dealing with graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have been successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks, similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges, we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable projection vector. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer restores the graph into its original structure using the position information of nodes selected in the corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and gUnpool layers, we develop an encoder-decoder model on graph, known as the graph U-Nets. Our experimental results on node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models.},

In this work we propose a new method that combines Digital Image Processing, Mathematical Morphology and a robust and powerful Machine Learning model: a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The enclosed macular region is subjected to a contrast enhancement method, followed by the application of basic morphological operations.

METHODS: 147 diabetic and 32 normal images were captured from a fundus camera, stored on computer, and analysed using a back propagation neural network. The network was trained to recognise features in the retinal image. The effects of digital filtering techniques and different network variables were assessed. 200 diabetic and 101 normal images were then randomised and used to evaluate the network's performance for the detection of diabetic retinopathy against an ophthalmologist. RESULTS: Detection rates for the recognition of vessels, exudates, and haemorrhages were 91.7\%, 93.1\%, and 73.8\% respectively. When compared with the results of the ophthalmologist, the network achieved a sensitivity of 88.4\% and a specificity of 83.5\% for the detection of diabetic retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of vessels, exudates, and haemorrhages was possible, with success rates dependent upon preprocessing and the number of images used in training. When compared with the ophthalmologist, the network achieved good accuracy for the detection of diabetic retinopathy. The system could be used as an aid to the screening of diabetic patients for retinopathy.},

  abstract = {Purpose Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness globally. Performing retinal screening examinations on all diabetic patients is an unmet need, and there are many undiagnosed and untreated cases of DR. The objective of this study was to develop robust diagnostic technology to automate DR screening. Referral of eyes with DR to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment would aid in reducing the rate of vision loss, enabling timely and accurate diagnoses. Design We developed and evaluated a data-driven deep learning algorithm as a novel diagnostic tool for automated DR detection. The algorithm processed color fundus images and classified them as healthy (no~retinopathy) or having DR, identifying relevant cases for medical referral. Methods A total of 75\,137 publicly available fundus images from diabetic patients were used to train and test an artificial intelligence model to differentiate healthy fundi from those with DR. A panel of retinal specialists determined the ground truth for our data set before experimentation. We also tested our model using the public MESSIDOR 2 and E-Ophtha databases for external validation. Information learned in our automated method was visualized readily through an automatically generated abnormality heatmap, highlighting subregions within each input fundus image for further clinical review. Main Outcome Measures We used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a metric to measure the precision–recall trade-off of our algorithm, reporting associated sensitivity and specificity metrics on the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Our model achieved a 0.97 AUC with a 94\% and 98\% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, on 5-fold cross-validation using our local data set. Testing against the independent MESSIDOR 2 and E-Ophtha databases achieved a 0.94 and 0.95 AUC score, respectively. Conclusions A fully data-driven artificial intelligence–based grading algorithm can be used to screen fundus photographs obtained from diabetic patients and to identify, with high reliability, which cases should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment. The implementation of such an algorithm on a global basis could reduce drastically the rate of vision loss attributed to DR.},

For the detection of retinopathy lesions from retinal images, several automatic approaches based on deep neural networks have been developed in the recent years. Most of the proposed methods produce point estimates of pixels belonging to the lesion areas and give no or little information on the uncertainty of method predictions. However, the latter can be essential in the examination of the medical condition of the patient when the goal is early detection of abnormalities. This work extends the recent research with a Bayesian framework by considering the parameters of a convolutional neural network as random variables and utilizing stochastic variational dropout based approximation for uncertainty quantification. The framework includes an extended validation procedure and it allows analyzing lesion segmentation distributions, model calibration and prediction uncertainties. Also the challenges related to the deep probabilistic model and uncertainty quantification are presented. The proposed method achieves area under precision-recall curve of 0.84 for hard exudates, 0.641 for soft exudates, 0.593 for haemorrhages, and 0.484 for microaneurysms on IDRiD dataset.},

  abstract = {With the introduction of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), much larger image datasets are routinely acquired compared to what was possible using the previous generation of time-domain OCT. Thus, the need for 3-D segmentation methods for processing such data is becoming increasingly important. We report a graph-theoretic segmentation method for the simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3-D surfaces that is guaranteed to be optimal with respect to the cost function and that is directly applicable to the segmentation of 3-D spectral OCT image data. We present two extensions to the general layered graph segmentation method: the ability to incorporate varying feasibility constraints and the ability to incorporate true regional information. Appropriate feasibility constraints and cost functions were learned from a training set of 13 spectral-domain OCT images from 13 subjects. After training, our approach was tested on a test set of 28 images from 14 subjects. An overall mean unsigned border positioning error of 5.69+/-2.41 microm was achieved when segmenting seven surfaces (six layers) and using the average of the manual tracings of two ophthalmologists as the reference standard. This result is very comparable to the measured interobserver variability of 5.71+/-1.98 microm.},

The purpose of this article is to discuss the problem of interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) and highlight the need for continuing scientific discovery using AI algorithms to deal with medical big data. CONCLUSION. A plethora of AI algorithms are currently being used in medical research, but the opacity of these algorithms makes their clinical implementation a dilemma. Clinical decision making cannot be assigned to something that we do not understand. Therefore, AI research should not be limited to reporting accuracy and sensitivity but, rather, should try to explain the underlying reasons for the predictions, in an attempt to enrich biologic understanding and knowledge.},

In this work, two new methods for the detection of exudates are presented which do not use a supervised learning step; therefore, they do not require labelled lesion training sets which are time consuming to create, difficult to obtain and prone to human error. We introduce a new dataset of fundus images from various ethnic groups and levels of DME which we have made publicly available. We evaluate our algorithm with this dataset and compare our results with two recent exudate segmentation algorithms. In all of our tests, our algorithms perform better or comparable with an order of magnitude reduction in computational time.},

  abstract = {There has recently been a surge of work in explanatory artificial intelligence (XAI). This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert \& Weston, 2008; Mnih \& Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a “better” basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact).},

  abstract = {Background and Objective~         The authors conducted a controlled study to quantify macular retinal thickness in diabetic retinopathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT) as an objective and noninvasive tool. The relationship between retinal thickness and standard methods of evaluating macular edema was investigated.         Patients and Methods~         A total of 136 patients in different stages of diabetic retinopathy were examined with OCT. In addition, fluorescein angiograms as well as standard eye examinations were conducted. The control group consisted of 30 individuals with a normal macula.         Results~         In the controls, retinal thickness was 153 ± 15 μm in the fovea, 249 ± 19 μm in the temporal parafoveal region, and 268 ± 20 μm in the nasal parafoveal region. In diabetic patients, retinal thickness was increased to 307 ± 136 μm in the fovea, 337 ± 88 μm in the temporal retina, and 353 ± 95 μm in the nasal retina, respectively. The differences between diabetics and controls were highly significant (P {$<$} 0.001). Retinal thickening correlated with fluorescein leakage in the angiograms to some extent. There was an intermediate correlation between retinal thickness and visual acuity, particularly in patients without macular ischemia. Sensitivity of detecting clinically significant macular edema by measuring foveal retinal thickness was 89\% and specificity was 96\%.         Conclusion~         Optical coherence tomography allows us to quantify retinal thickness in diabetic retinopathy with excellent reproducibility. OCT is able to detect sight-threatening macular edema with great reliability.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show impressive performance for image classification and detection, extending heavily to the medical image domain. Nevertheless, medical experts are skeptical in these predictions as the nonlinear multilayer structure resulting in a classification outcome is not directly graspable. Recently, approaches have been shown which help the user to understand the discriminative regions within an image which are decisive for the CNN to conclude to a certain class. Although these approaches could help to build trust in the CNNs predictions, they are only slightly shown to work with medical image data which often poses a challenge as the decision for a class relies on different lesion areas scattered around the entire image. Using the DiaretDB1 dataset, we show that on retina images different lesion areas fundamental for diabetic retinopathy are detected on an image level with high accuracy, comparable or exceeding supervised methods. On lesion level, we achieve few false positives with high sensitivity, though, the network is solely trained on image-level labels which do not include information about existing lesions. Classifying between diseased and healthy images, we achieve an AUC of 0.954 on the DiaretDB1.},

  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate ultrahigh-resolution, three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3D-OCT) and projection OCT fundus imaging for enhanced visualisation of outer retinal pathology in non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: A high-speed, 3.5 μm resolution OCT prototype instrument was developed for the ophthalmic clinic. Eighty-three patients with non-exudative AMD were imaged. Projection OCT fundus images were generated from 3D-OCT data by selectively summing different retinal depth levels. Results were compared with standard ophthalmic examination, including fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, when indicated. Results: Projection OCT fundus imaging enhanced the visualisation of outer retinal pathology in non-exudative AMD. Different types of drusen exhibited distinct features in projection OCT images. Photoreceptor disruption was indicated by loss of the photoreceptor inner/outer segment (IS/OS) boundary and external limiting membrane (ELM). RPE atrophy can be assessed using choroid-level projection OCT images. Conclusions: Projection OCT fundus imaging facilities rapid interpretation of large 3D-OCT data sets. Projection OCT enhances contrast and visualises outer retinal pathology not visible with standard fundus imaging or OCT fundus imaging. Projection OCT fundus images enable registration with standard ophthalmic diagnostics and cross-sectional OCT images. Outer retinal alterations can be assessed and drusen morphology, photoreceptor impairment and pigmentary abnormalities identified.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study aims to contribute to an understanding of the explainability of computer aided diagnosis studies in radiology that use end-to-end deep learning by providing a quantitative overview of methodological choices and by discussing the implications of these choices for their explainability. Methods A systematic review was executed using the preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. Primary diagnostic test accuracy studies using end-to-end deep learning for radiology were identified from the period January 1st, 2016, to January 20th, 2021. Results were synthesized by identifying the explanation goals, measures, and explainable AI techniques. Results This study identified 490 primary diagnostic test accuracy studies using end-to-end deep learning for radiology, of which 179 (37\%) used explainable AI. In 147 out of 179 (82\%) of studies, explainable AI was used for the goal of model visualization and inspection. Class activation mapping is the most common technique, being used in 117 out of 179 studies (65\%). Only 1 study used measures to evaluate the outcome of their explainable AI. Conclusions A considerable portion of computer aided diagnosis studies provide a form of explainability of their deep learning models for the purpose of model visualization and inspection. The techniques commonly chosen by these studies (class activation mapping, feature activation mapping and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) have potential limitations. Because researchers generally do not measure the quality of their explanations, we are agnostic about how effective these explanations are at addressing the black box issues of deep learning in radiology.},

In realworld applications, labels are usually collected from non-experts such as crowdsourcing to save cost and thus are noisy. In the past few years, deep learning methods for dealing with noisy labels have been developed, many of which are based on the small-loss criterion. However, there are few theoretical analyses to explain why these methods could learn well from noisy labels. In this paper, we theoretically explain why the widely-used small-loss criterion works. Based on the explanation, we reformalize the vanilla small-loss criterion to better tackle noisy labels. The experimental results verify our theoretical explanation and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the reformalization.},

  abstract = {Importance: More than 60 million people in India have diabetes and are at risk for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening disease. Automated interpretation of retinal fundus photographs can help support and scale a robust screening program to detect DR. Objective: To prospectively validate the performance of an automated DR system across 2 sites in India. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective observational study was conducted at 2 eye care centers in India (Aravind Eye Hospital and Sankara Nethralaya) and included 3049 patients with diabetes. Data collection and patient enrollment took place between April 2016 and July 2016 at Aravind and May 2016 and April 2017 at Sankara Nethralaya. The model was trained and fixed in March 2016. Interventions: Automated DR grading system compared with manual grading by 1 trained grader and 1 retina specialist from each site. Adjudication by a panel of 3 retinal specialists served as the reference standard in the cases of disagreement. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity and specificity for moderate or worse DR or referable diabetic macula edema. Results: Of 3049 patients, 1091 (35.8\%) were women and the mean (SD) age for patients at Aravind and Sankara Nethralaya was 56.6 (9.0) years and 56.0 (10.0) years, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, the sensitivity and specificity for manual grading by individual nonadjudicator graders ranged from 73.4\% to 89.8\% and from 83.5\% to 98.7\%, respectively. The automated DR system's performance was equal to or exceeded manual grading, with an 88.9\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 85.8-91.5), 92.2\% specificity (95\% CI, 90.3-93.8), and an area under the curve of 0.963 on the data set from Aravind Eye Hospital and 92.1\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 90.1-93.8), 95.2\% specificity (95\% CI, 94.2-96.1), and an area under the curve of 0.980 on the data set from Sankara Nethralaya. Conclusions and Relevance: This study shows that the automated DR system generalizes to this population of Indian patients in a prospective setting and demonstrates the feasibility of using an automated DR grading system to expand screening programs.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working population. Lesion segmentation from fundus images helps ophthalmologists accurately diagnose and grade of diabetic retinopathy. However, the task of lesion segmentation is full of challenges due to the complex structure, the various sizes and the interclass similarity with other fundus tissues. To address the issue, this paper proposes a cascade attentive RefineNet (CARNet) for automatic and accurate multi-lesion segmentation of diabetic retinopathy. It can make full use of the fine local details and coarse global information from the fundus image. CARNet is composed of global image encoder, local image encoder and attention refinement decoder. We take the whole image and the patch image as the dual input, and feed them to ResNet50 and ResNet101, respectively, for downsampling to extract lesion features. The high-level refinement decoder uses dual attention mechanism to integrate the same-level features in the two encoders with the output of the low-level attention refinement module for multiscale information fusion, which focus the model on the lesion area to generate accurate predictions. We evaluated the segmentation performance of the proposed CARNet on the IDRiD, E-ophtha and DDR data sets. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies on various data sets demonstrate the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and has better accuracy and robustness. It not only overcomes the interference of similar tissues and noises to achieve accurate multi-lesion segmentation, but also preserves the contour details and shape features of small lesions without overloading GPU memory usage.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fundus image analysis based computer aided system for automatic classification and grading of cataract, which provides great potentials to reduce the burden of well-experienced ophthalmologists (the scarce resources) and help cataract patients in under-developed areas to know timely their cataract conditions and obtain treatment suggestions from doctors. The system is composed of fundus image pre-processing, image feature extraction, and automatic cataract classification and grading. The wavelet transform and the sketch based methods are investigated to extract from fundus image the features suitable for cataract classification and grading. After feature extraction, a multiclass discriminant analysis algorithm is used for cataract classification, including two-class (cataract or non-cataract) classification and cataract grading in mild, moderate, and severe. A real-world dataset, including fundus image samples with mild, moderate, and severe cataract, is used for training and testing. The preliminary results show that, for the wavelet transform based method, the correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 90.9\% and 77.1\%, respectively. The correct classification rates of two-class classification and cataract grading are 86.1\% and 74.0\% for the sketch based method, which is comparable to the wavelet transform based method. The pilot study demonstrates that our research on fundus image analysis for cataract classification and grading is very helpful for improving the efficiency of fundus image review and ophthalmic healthcare quality. We believe that this work can serve as an important reference for the development of similar health information system to solve other medical diagnosis problems.},

The main related lesions include soft exudates, hard exudates, microaneurysms, and haemorrhages. However, segmentation of these four kinds of lesions is difficult due to their uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity. Therefore, we aim to design a multi-lesion segmentation model. We have designed the first small object segmentation network (L-Seg) that can segment the four kinds of lesions simultaneously. Taking into account that small lesion regions could not response at high level of network, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion method to handle this problem. In addition, when considering the cases of both class-imbalance and loss-imbalance problems, we propose a multi-channel bin loss. We have evaluated L-Seg on three fundus datasets including two publicly available datasets - IDRiD and e-ophtha and one private dataset - DDR. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that L-Seg achieves better performance in small lesion segmentation than other deep learning models and traditional methods. Specially, the mAUC score of L-Seg is over 16.8\%, 1.51\% and 3.11\% higher than that of DeepLab v3+ on IDRiD, e-ophtha and DDR datasets, respectively.

  abstract = {Transformer, first applied to the field of natural language processing, is a type of deep neural network mainly based on the self-attention mechanism. Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Given its high performance and no need for human-defined inductive bias, transformer is receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this paper, we review these visual transformer models by categorizing them in different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision, low-level vision, and video processing. We also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Furthermore, we include efficient transformer methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research directions for visual transformers.},

  abstract = {Glaucoma is a medical term describing a group of progressive optic neuropathies characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and retinal nerve fibre layer and resulting in changes in the optic nerve head. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. With the aging population it is expected that the prevalence of glaucoma will continue to increase. Despite recent advances in imaging and visual field testing techniques that allow establishment of earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation, significant numbers of glaucoma patients are undiagnosed and present late in the course of their disease. This can lead to irreversible vision loss, reduced quality of life, and a higher socioeconomic burden. Selection of therapeutic approaches for glaucoma should be based on careful ocular examination, patient medical history, presence of comorbidities, and awareness of concomitant systemic therapies. Therapy should also be individualized to patients' needs and preferences. Recent developments in this therapeutic field require revisiting treatment algorithms and integration of traditional and novel approaches in order to ensure optimal visual outcomes. This article provides an overview of recent developments and practice trends in the medical management of glaucoma in Canada. A discussion of the surgical management is beyond the scope of this paper.},

This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based retinal fluids segmentation network (RFS-Net) to segment and recognize three MRF lesion manifestations, namely, intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), and pigment epithelial detachment (PED), from multi-vendor optical coherence tomography (OCT) imagery. The proposed image analysis tool will optimize anti-VEGF therapy and contribute to reducing the inter- and intra-observer variability. Method The proposed RFS-Net architecture integrates the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), residual, and inception modules in the encoder path to learn better features and conserve more global information for precise segmentation and characterization of MRF lesions. The RFS-Net model is trained and validated using OCT scans from multiple vendors (Topcon, Cirrus, Spectralis), collected from three publicly available datasets. The first dataset consisted of OCT volumes obtained from 112 subjects (a total of 11,334~B-scans) is used for both training and evaluation purposes. Moreover, the remaining two datasets are only used for evaluation purposes to check the trained RFS-Net's generalizability on unseen OCT scans. The two evaluation datasets contain a total of 1572 OCT B-scans from 1255 subjects. The performance of the proposed RFS-Net model is assessed through various evaluation metrics. Results The proposed RFS-Net model achieved the mean F1 scores of 0.762, 0.796, and 0.805 for segmenting IRF, SRF, and PED. Moreover, with the automated segmentation of the three retinal manifestations, the RFS-Net brings a considerable gain in efficiency compared to the tedious and demanding manual segmentation procedure of the MRF. Conclusions Our proposed RFS-Net is a potential diagnostic tool for the automatic segmentation of MRF (IRF, SRF, and PED) lesions.

  abstract = {Retinopathy represents a group of retinal diseases that, if not treated timely, can cause severe visual impairments or even blindness. Many researchers have developed autonomous systems to recognize retinopathy via fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imagery. However, most of these frameworks employ conventional transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches, requiring a decent amount of well-annotated training data to produce accurate diagnostic performance. This article presents a novel incremental cross-domain adaptation instrument that allows any deep classification model to progressively learn abnormal retinal pathologies in OCT and fundus imagery via few-shot training. Furthermore, unlike its competitors, the proposed instrument is driven via a Bayesian multiobjective function that not only enforces the candidate classification network to retain its prior learned knowledge during incremental training, but also ensures that the network understands the structural and semantic relationships between previously learned pathologies and newly added disease categories to effectively recognize them at the inference stage. The proposed framework, evaluated on six public datasets acquired with three different scanners to screen 13 retinal pathologies, outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors by achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.9826 and 0.9846, respectively.},

Many researchers have presented studies on optical coherence tomography (OCT) based retinal image analysis over the past. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no framework yet available that can extract retinal lesions from multi-vendor OCT scans and utilize them for the intuitive severity grading of the human retina. To cater this lack, we propose a deep retinal analysis and grading framework (RAG-FW). RAG-FW is a hybrid convolutional framework that extracts multiple retinal lesions from OCT scans and utilizes them for lesion-influenced grading of retinopathy as per the clinical standards. RAG-FW has been rigorously tested on 43,613 scans from five highly complex publicly available datasets, containing multi-vendor scans, where it achieved the mean intersection-over-union score of 0.8055 for extracting the retinal lesions and the accuracy of 98.70\% for the correct severity grading of retinopathy.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\% [33]).

The LSGAN can expand the dataset to address the issue of overfitting when only limited OCT training samples are available. Specifically, our LSGAN consists of three components: generator, discriminator, and classifier. The generator generates synthetic unlabeled images that are similar to the real OCT images, while the discriminator distinguishes whether the synthetic images are real or generated. To train the classifier with both real labeled images and synthetic unlabeled images, we design artificial pseudo labels as label smoothing for the synthetic unlabeled images. Thus, the mixing of the synthetic images and real images can be used as training data to improve the classification performance. Experimental results on two real OCT datasets demonstrate the superiority of our LSGAN method over several well-known classifiers, especially under the condition of limited training data.},

However, assessing how XAI techniques can help understand models beyond classification tasks, e.g. for reinforcement learning (RL), has not been extensively studied. We review recent works in the direction to attain Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), a relatively new subfield of Explainable Artificial Intelligence, intended to be used in general public applications, with diverse audiences, requiring ethical, responsible and trustable algorithms. In critical situations where it is essential to justify and explain the agent’s behaviour, better explainability and interpretability of RL models could help gain scientific insight on the inner workings of what is still considered a black box. We evaluate mainly studies directly linking explainability to RL, and split these into two categories according to the way the explanations are generated: transparent algorithms and post-hoc explainability. We also review the most prominent XAI works from the lenses of how they could potentially enlighten the further deployment of the latest advances in RL, in the demanding present and future of everyday problems.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Adversarial adaptation models have shown tremendous progress towards adapting to new environments by focusing either on discovering domain invariant representations or by mapping between unpaired image domains. While feature space methods are difficult to interpret and sometimes fail to capture pixel-level and low-level domain shifts, image space methods sometimes fail to incorporate high level semantic knowledge relevant for the end task. We propose a model which adapts between domains using both generative image space alignment and latent representation space alignment. Our approach, Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CyCADA), guides transfer between domains according to a specific discriminatively trained task and avoids divergence by enforcing consistency of the relevant semantics before and after adaptation. We evaluate our method on a variety of visual recognition and prediction settings, including digit classification and semantic segmentation of road scenes, advancing state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised adaptation from synthetic to real world driving domains.},

  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge {$>$} Human Centricity and User Interaction},

The authors evaluate their method using hand-labeled ground truth segmentations of 20 images. A plot of the operating characteristic shows that the authors' method reduces false positives by as much as 15 times over basic thresholding of a matched filter response (MFR), at up to a 75\% true positive rate. For a baseline, they also compared the ground truth against a second hand-labeling, yielding a 90\% true positive and a 4\% false positive detection rate, on average. These numbers suggest there is still room for a 15\% true positive rate improvement, with the same false positive rate, over the authors' method.

Especially, deep learning has great superiority in image analysis and disease prediction. In this paper, we use Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as an example to show advantages of deep learning in diagnosing brain diseases and providing clinical decision support. Firstly, we convert raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides strong reference for AD prediction. Compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM), about 25\% improvement is gained in prediction accuracy. The e-health field becomes more complete and effective owing to that. Our work helps predict AD at an early stage and take measures to slow down or even prevent the onset of it.},

  abstract = {Segmenting retinal vessels in optic nerve head (ONH) centered spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volumes is particularly challenging due to the projected neural canal opening (NCO) and relatively low visibility in the ONH center. Color fundus photographs provide a relatively high vessel contrast in the region inside the NCO, but have not been previously used to aid the SD-OCT vessel segmentation process. Thus, in this paper, we present two approaches for the segmentation of retinal vessels in SD-OCT volumes that each take advantage of complimentary information from fundus photographs. In the first approach (referred to as the registered-fundus vessel segmentation approach), vessels are first segmented on the fundus photograph directly (using a k-NN pixel classifier) and this vessel segmentation result is mapped to the SD-OCT volume through the registration of the fundus photograph to the SD-OCT volume. In the second approach (referred to as the multimodal vessel segmentation approach), after fundus-to-SD-OCT registration, vessels are simultaneously segmented with a k-NN classifier using features from both modalities. Three-dimensional structural information from the intraretinal layers and neural canal opening obtained through graph-theoretic segmentation approaches of the SD-OCT volume are used in combination with Gaussian filter banks and Gabor wavelets to generate the features. The approach is trained on 15 and tested on 19 randomly chosen independent image pairs of SD-OCT volumes and fundus images from 34 subjects with glaucoma. Based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the present registered-fundus and multimodal vessel segmentation approaches [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.89, respectively] both perform significantly better than the two previous OCT-based approaches (AUC of 0.78 and 0.83, p {$<$}; 0.05). The multimodal approach overall performs significantly better than the other three approaches (p {$<$}; 0.05).},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are built upon the convolution operation, which extracts informative features by fusing spatial and channel-wise information together within local receptive fields. In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251\%, achieving a 25\% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

To efficiently learn deep embeddings on the high-order graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module. …},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models.

  abstract = {Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Earlier detection and timely treatment of DR are desirable to reduce the incidence and progression of vision loss. Currently, deep learning (DL) approaches have offered better performance in detecting DR from retinal fundus images. We, therefore, performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of DL algorithms for detecting DR. Methods A systematic literature search on EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus was performed between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2019. The search strategy was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, and DL-based study design was mandatory for articles inclusion. Two independent authors screened abstracts and titles against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two authors independently using a standard form and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used for the risk of bias and applicability assessment. Results Twenty-three studies were included in the systematic review; 20 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The pooled area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC) of DR was 0.97 (95\%CI: 0.95–0.98), sensitivity was 0.83 (95\%CI: 0.83–0.83), and specificity was 0.92 (95\%CI: 0.92–0.92). The positive- and negative-likelihood ratio were 14.11 (95\%CI: 9.91–20.07), and 0.10 (95\%CI: 0.07–0.16), respectively. Moreover, the diagnostic odds ratio for DL models was 136.83 (95\%CI: 79.03–236.93). All the studies provided a DR-grading scale, a human grader (e.g. trained caregivers, ophthalmologists) as a reference standard. Conclusion The findings of our study showed that DL algorithms had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable DR from retinal fundus photographs. Applying a DL-based automated tool of assessing DR from color fundus images could provide an alternative solution to reduce misdiagnosis and improve workflow. A DL-based automated tool offers substantial benefits to reduce screening costs, accessibility to healthcare and ameliorate earlier treatments.},

Explaining the decisions of AI systems in human terms is a key challenge—due to the high complexity of the model, as well as the potential implications on human interests, rights, and lives . While Explainable AI is an emerging field of research, there is no consensus on the definition, quantification, and formalization of explainability. In fact, the quantification of explainability is an open challenge. In our previous work, we incorporated domain knowledge for better explainability, however, we were unable to quantify the extent of explainability. In this work, we (1) briefly analyze the definitions of explainability from the perspective of different disciplines (e.g., psychology, social science), properties of explanation, explanation methods, and human-friendly explanations; and (2) propose and formulate an approach to quantify the extent of explainability. Our experimental result suggests a reasonable and model-agnostic way to quantify explainability.},

  abstract = {Purpose To review basic principles of optical coherence tomography, and to describe its use in the diagnosis and management of retinal diseases and glaucoma. Design Perspective. Methods Literature review. Results Optical coherence tomography is a noninvasive imaging technique that has been used increasingly to diagnose and manage a variety of retinal diseases and glaucoma. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is based on the principal of Michelson interferometry. Interference patterns produced by low coherence light reflected from retinal tissues and a reference mirror are processed into an “A-scan” signal. Multiple A-scan signals are aligned to produce a two-dimensional image that can be thought of as a form of “in vivo histology.” Optical coherence tomography has been used to identify macular holes, to differentiate macular holes from simulating lesions, to identify lamellar macular holes, macular cysts, vitreomacular traction, subretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detachment, and choroidal neovascularization. It can be used to identify and quantify macular edema, and to measure retinal thickness changes in response to therapy. Macular thickness measurements determined by OCT correlate well with visual acuity and with leakage observed by fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography is an accurate and reproducible method to measure retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Particularly, when used in combination with other optic nerve imaging techniques, it can be used to differentiate glaucomatous eyes from normal eyes. Despite its usefulness, OCT has its limitations. Optical coherence tomography equipment is expensive, and not all insurance companies reimburse this procedure. Image quality is dependent on operator technique and can be degraded in the presence of media opacity. Change analysis software for glaucoma applications is not fully developed, and there is a scarcity of age, gender, and race-specific normative data upon which to compare eyes with retinal disease and glaucoma. In the next few years, it is likely that the role of OCT as a method to diagnose and manage retinal disease and glaucoma will be further defined, and many of the current limitations will be overcome. Conclusions Optical coherence tomography is a useful imaging technique to diagnose and manage a variety of retinal diseases and glaucoma. Care is needed to avoid artifacts and image misinterpretation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we aimed to understand and analyze the outputs of a convolutional neural network model that classifies the laterality of fundus images. Our model not only automatizes the classification process, which results in reducing the labors of clinicians, but also highlights the key regions in the image and evaluates the uncertainty for the decision with proper analytic tools. Our model was trained and tested with 25,911 fundus images (43.4\% of macula-centered images and 28.3\% each of superior and nasal retinal fundus images). Also, activation maps were generated to mark important regions in the image for the classification. Then, uncertainties were quantified to support explanations as to why certain images were incorrectly classified under the proposed model. Our model achieved a mean training accuracy of 99\%, which is comparable to the performance of clinicians. Strong activations were detected at the location of optic disc and retinal blood vessels around the disc, which matches to the regions that clinicians attend when deciding the laterality. Uncertainty analysis discovered that misclassified images tend to accompany with high prediction uncertainties and are likely ungradable. We believe that visualization of informative regions and the estimation of uncertainty, along with presentation of the prediction result, would enhance the interpretability of neural network models in a way that clinicians can be benefitted from using the automatic classification system.},

However, most papers proposing such measures study only a small set of models, leaving open the question of whether the conclusion drawn from those experiments would remain valid in other settings. We present the first large scale study of generalization in deep networks. We investigate more then 40 complexity measures taken from both theoretical bounds and empirical studies. We train over 10,000 convolutional networks by systematically varying commonly used hyperparameters. Hoping to uncover potentially causal relationships between each measure and generalization, we analyze carefully controlled experiments and show surprising failures of some measures as well as promising measures for further research.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of large collections of electronic health record (EHR) data and unprecedented technical advances in deep learning (DL) have sparked a surge of research interest in developing DL based clinical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Despite the recognition of the value of deep learning in healthcare, impediments to further adoption in real healthcare settings remain due to the black-box nature of DL. Therefore, there is an emerging need for interpretable DL, which allows end users to evaluate the model decision making to know whether to accept or reject predictions and recommendations before an action is taken. In this review, we focus on the interpretability of the DL models in healthcare. We start by introducing the methods for interpretability in depth and comprehensively as a methodological reference for future researchers or clinical practitioners in this field. Besides the methods' details, we also include a discussion of advantages and disadvantages of these methods and which scenarios each of them is suitable for, so that interested readers can know how to compare and choose among them for use. Moreover, we discuss how these methods, originally developed for solving general-domain problems, have been adapted and applied to healthcare problems and how they can help physicians better understand these data-driven technologies. Overall, we hope this survey can help researchers and practitioners in both artificial intelligence and clinical fields understand what methods we have for enhancing the interpretability of their DL models and choose the optimal one accordingly.

  abstract = {The orbital cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) represents the true counter-pressure against the intraocular pressure (IOP) across the lamina cribrosa and is, therefore, one of the two determinants of the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference (TLPD). From this anatomic point of view, an elevated TLPD could be due to elevated IOP or abnormally low orbital CSFP. Both experimental and clinical studies have suggested that a low CSFP could be associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy in normal-pressure glaucoma. These included monkey studies with an experimental long-term reduction in CSFP, and clinical retrospective and prospective studies on patients with normal-pressure glaucoma. Since the choroidal blood drains via the vortex veins through the superior ophthalmic vein into the intracranial cavernous sinus, anatomy suggests that the CSFP could influence choroidal thickness. A population-based study revealed that thicker subfoveal choroidal thickness was associated with higher CSFP. Since the central retinal vein passes through the orbital CSF space, anatomy suggests that the retinal venous pressure should be at least as high as the orbital CSFP. Other experimental, clinical or population-based studies suggested an association between higher CSFP and higher retinal venous pressure and wider retinal veins. Consequently, a higher estimated CSFP was associated with arterial hypertensive retinopathy (with respect to the dilated retinal vein diameter and higher arterial-to-venous diameter) and with the prevalence, severity and incidence of diabetic retinopathy. Physiologically, CSFP was related with higher IOP. The influence of the CSFP on the episcleral venous pressure and/or a regulation of both CSFP and IOP by a center in the dorsomedial/perifornical hypothalamus may be responsible for this. In~summary, the CSFP may be an overlooked parameter in ocular physiology and pathology. Abnormal changes in the CSFP, in particular in relationship to the IOP, may have pathophysiologic importance.},

  abstract = {A significant number of tropical cyclones move into the midlatitudes and transform into extratropical cyclones. This process is generally referred to as extratropical transition (ET). During ET a cyclone frequently produces intense rainfall and strong winds and has increased forward motion, so that such systems pose a serious threat to land and maritime activities. Changes in the structure of a system as it evolves from a tropical to an extratropical cyclone during ET necessitate changes in forecast strategies. In this paper a brief climatology of ET is given and the challenges associated with forecasting extratropical transition are described in terms of the forecast variables (track, intensity, surface winds, precipitation) and their impacts (flooding, bush fires, ocean response). The problems associated with the numerical prediction of ET are discussed. A comprehensive review of the current understanding of the processes involved in ET is presented. Classifications of extratropical transition are described and potential vorticity thinking is presented as an aid to understanding ET. Further sections discuss the interaction between a tropical cyclone and the midlatitude environment, the role of latent heat release, convection and the underlying surface in ET, the structural changes due to frontogenesis, the mechanisms responsible for precipitation, and the energy budget during ET. Finally, a summary of the future directions for research into ET is given.},

  abstract = {Automatic retinal image analysis is emerging as an important screening tool for early detection of eye diseases. Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness. The manual examination of optic disk (OD) is a standard procedure used for detecting glaucoma. In this paper, we present an automatic OD parameterization technique based on segmented OD and cup regions obtained from monocular retinal images. A novel OD segmentation method is proposed which integrates the local image information around each point of interest in multidimensional feature space to provide robustness against variations found in and around the OD region. We also propose a novel cup segmentation method which is based on anatomical evidence such as vessel bends at the cup boundary, considered relevant by glaucoma experts. Bends in a vessel are robustly detected using a region of support concept, which automatically selects the right scale for analysis. A multi-stage strategy is employed to derive a reliable subset of vessel bends called r-bends followed by a local spline fitting to derive the desired cup boundary. The method has been evaluated on 138 images comprising 33 normal and 105 glaucomatous images against three glaucoma experts. The obtained segmentation results show consistency in handling various geometric and photometric variations found across the dataset. The estimation error of the method for vertical cup-to-disk diameter ratio is 0.09/0.08 (mean/standard deviation) while for cup-to-disk area ratio it is 0.12/0.10. Overall, the obtained qualitative and quantitative results show effectiveness in both segmentation and subsequent OD parameterization for glaucoma assessment.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence techniques powered by deep neural nets have achieved much success in several application domains, most significantly and notably in the Computer Vision applications and Natural Language Processing tasks. Surpassing human-level performance propelled the research in the applications where different modalities amongst language, vision, sensory, text play an important role in accurate predictions and identification. Several multimodal fusion methods employing deep learning models are proposed in the literature. Despite their outstanding performance, the complex, opaque and black-box nature of the deep neural nets limits their social acceptance and usability. This has given rise to the quest for model interpretability and explainability, more so in the complex tasks involving multimodal AI methods. This paper extensively reviews the present literature to present a comprehensive survey and commentary on the explainability in multimodal deep neural nets, especially for the vision and language tasks. Several topics on multimodal AI and its applications for generic domains have been covered in this paper, including the significance, datasets, fundamental building blocks of the methods and techniques, challenges, applications, and future trends in this domain.},

  abstract = {The literature on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) in mental health and psychiatry lacks consensus on what “explainability” means. In the more general XAI (eXplainable AI) literature, there has been some convergence on explainability meaning model-agnostic techniques that augment a complex model (with internal mechanics intractable for human understanding) with a simpler model argued to deliver results that humans can comprehend. Given the differing usage and intended meaning of the term “explainability” in AI and ML, we propose instead to approximate model/algorithm explainability by understandability defined as a function of transparency and interpretability. These concepts are easier to articulate, to “ground” in our understanding of how algorithms and models operate and are used more consistently in the literature. We describe the TIFU (Transparency and Interpretability For Understandability) framework and examine how this applies to the landscape of AI/ML in mental health research. We argue that the need for understandablity is heightened in psychiatry because data describing the syndromes, outcomes, disorders and signs/symptoms possess probabilistic relationships to each other—as do the tentative aetiologies and multifactorial social- and psychological-determinants of disorders. If we develop and deploy AI/ML models, ensuring human understandability of the inputs, processes and outputs of these models is essential to develop trustworthy systems fit for deployment.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of legal blindness in the United States. Considering the increasing incidence of DR, it is extremely important to detect the most cost-effective tools for DR screening, so as to manage this surge in demand and the socioeconomic burden it places on the health care system. Despite the advances in retinal imaging, analysis techniques are still superseded by expert ophthalmologist interpretation. Teleophthalmology presents an immense opportunity, with high rates of sensitivity and specificity, to manage the steadily increasing demand for eye care of patients with diabetes, but challenges remain in the delivery of practical, viable, and clinically proven solutions. RESUMEN La retinopatía diabética (RD) es la causa principal de ceguera legal en los Estados Unidos. Teniendo en cuenta la creciente incidencia de RD, es extremadamente importante detectar las herramientas más económicas para su cribado, para poder gestionar esta demanda creciente, así como la carga socioeconómica que supone para el sistema sanitario. A pesar de los avances en términos de imagen retiniana, las técnicas de análisis siguen siendo reemplazadas por la interpretación de los oftalmólogos expertos. La tele-oftalmología se presenta como una gran oportunidad, con altas tasas de sensibilidad y especificidad, para gestionar el aumento constante de la atención ocular en los pacientes diabéticos, aunque la aportación de soluciones clínicamente probadas sigue suponiendo un reto.},

Different automated approaches such as image processing, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used for early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases. Unfortunately, these are prone to error and computational inefficiency, which requires further intervention from human experts. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution neural network architecture to successfully distinguish between different degeneration of retinal layers and their underlying causes. The proposed novel architecture outperforms other classification models while addressing the issue of gradient explosion. Our approach reaches near perfect accuracy of 99.8\% and 100\% for two separately available Retinal SD-OCT data-set respectively. Additionally, our architecture predicts retinal diseases in real time while outperforming human diagnosticians.},

Convolutions enjoy important properties such as sparse interactions, weight sharing, and translation equivariance. These properties give convolutional neural networks (CNNs) a strong and useful inductive bias for vision tasks. However, the convolution operation also has important shortcomings: it performs a fixed operation on every test image regardless of the content and it cannot efficiently model long-range interactions. In this work we show that a network based on self-attention between neighboring patches and without any convolution operations can achieve better results. Given a 3D image block, our network divides it into n3n3n\^3 3D patches, where n=3 or 5n=3 or 5n=3 \textbackslash text \{ or \} 5 and computes a 1D embedding for each patch. The network predicts the segmentation map for the center patch of the block based on the self-attention between these patch embeddings.

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy, an asymptomatic complication of diabetes, is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. The exudates, abnormal leaked fatty deposits on retina, are one of the most prevalent and earliest clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy. In this paper, a generalized exudates segmentation method to assist ophthalmologists for timely treatment and effective planning in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is developed. The main contribution of the proposed method is the reliable segmentation of exudates using dynamic decision thresholding irrespective of associated heterogeneity, bright and faint edges. The method is robust in the sense that it selects the threshold value dynamically irrespective of the large variations in retinal fundus images from varying databases. Since no performance comparison of state of the art methods is available on common database, therefore, to make a fair comparison of the proposed method, this work has been performed on a diversified database having 1307 retinal fundus images of varying characteristics namely: location, shapes, color and sizes. The database comprises of 649 clinically acquired retinal fundus images from eye hospital and 658 retinal images from publicly available databases such as STARE, MESSIDOR, DIARETDB1 and e-Optha EX. The segmentation results are validated by performing two sets of experiments namely: lesion based evaluation criteria and image based evaluation criteria. Experimental results at lesion level show that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods with a mean sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of 88.85/96.15/93.46 on a composite database of retinal fundus images. The segmentation results for image-based evaluation with a mean sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of 94.62/98.64/96.74 respectively prove the clinical effectiveness of the method. Furthermore, the significant collective performance of these experiments on clinically as well as publicly available standard databases proves the generalization ability and the strong candidature of the proposed method in the real-time diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.},

  abstract = {The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related~macular degeneration and diabetic macular~edema. We also provide a more transparent and~interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia~using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral~of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. Video Abstract},

  abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of Neural Networks, which has shown exemplary performance on several competitions related to Computer Vision and Image Processing. Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel boosting, and attention. Additionally, the elementary understanding of CNN components, current challenges, and applications of CNN are also provided.},

  abstract = {Whether the characteristics of tropical cyclones have changed or will change in a warming climate — and if so, how — has been the subject of considerable investigation, often with conflicting results. Large amplitude fluctuations in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones greatly complicate both the detection of long-term trends and their attribution to rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Trend detection is further impeded by substantial limitations in the availability and quality of global historical records of tropical cyclones. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity have exceeded the variability expected from natural causes. However, future projections based on theory and high-resolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms, with intensity increases of 2–11\% by 2100. Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones, by 6–34\%. Balanced against this, higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones, and increases of the order of 20\% in the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre. For all cyclone parameters, projected changes for individual basins show large variations between different modelling studies.},

  abstract = {We aim to better understand attention over nodes in graph neural networks (GNNs) and identify factors influencing its effectiveness. We particularly focus on the ability of attention GNNs to generalize to larger, more complex or noisy graphs. Motivated by insights from the work on Graph Isomorphism Networks, we design simple graph reasoning tasks that allow us to study attention in a controlled environment. We find that under typical conditions the effect of attention is negligible or even harmful, but under certain conditions it provides an exceptional gain in performance of more than 60\% in some of our classification tasks. Satisfying these conditions in practice is challenging and often requires optimal initialization or supervised training of attention. We propose an alternative recipe and train attention in a weakly-supervised fashion that approaches the performance of supervised models, and, compared to unsupervised models, improves results on several synthetic as well as real datasets.

Objective and quantitative assessment of quality for the acquired images is essential for manual, computer-aided and fully automatic diagnosis. In this paper, we present a noreference quality metric to quantify image noise and blur and its application to fundus image quality assessment. The proposed metric takes the vessel tree visible on the retina as guidance to determine an image quality score. In our experiments, the performance of this approach is demonstrated by correlation analysis with the established full-reference metrics peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). We found a Spearman rank correlation for PSNR and SSIM of 0.89 and 0.91. For real data, our metric correlates reasonable to a human observer, indicating high agreement to human visual perception.},

In clinical applications for example, it might not be clear from a CT scan alone which particular region is cancer tissue. Therefore a group of graders typically produces a set of diverse but plausible segmentations. We consider the task of learning a distribution over segmentations given an input. To this end we propose a generative segmentation model based on a combination of a U-Net with a conditional variational autoencoder that is capable of efficiently producing an unlimited number of plausible hypotheses. We show on a lung abnormalities segmentation task and on a Cityscapes segmentation task that our model reproduces the possible segmentation variants as well as the frequencies with which they occur, doing so significantly better than published approaches. These models could have a high impact in real-world applications, such as being used as clinical decision-making algorithms accounting for multiple plausible semantic segmentation hypotheses to provide possible diagnoses and recommend further actions to resolve the present ambiguities.},

The proposed framework consists of three steps: global dataset pre-registration, preprocessing and OCT to fundus image registration. Two alternating registration criteria are used in the main step due to changing spatial image properties. Three-parametric spatial transformation (shift and scale) for each OCT scan and exhaustive search is used in this preliminarily work. The achieved results are presented on several examples.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy is a pathological change of the retina that occurs for long-term diabetes. The patients become symptomatic in advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy resulting in severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or proliferative diabetic retinopathy stages. There is a need of an automated screening tool for the early detection and treatment of patients with diabetic retinopathy. This paper focuses on the segmentation of red lesions using nested U-Net Zhou et al. (Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis and Multimodal Learning for Clinical Decision Support, Springer, 2018)~followed by removal of false positives based on the sub-image classification method. Different sizes of sub-images were studied for the reduction in false positives in the sub-image classification method. The network could capture semantic features and fine details due to dense convolutional blocks connected via skip connections in between down sampling and up sampling paths. False-negative candidates were very few and the sub-image classification network effectively reduced the falsely detected candidates. The proposed framework achieves a sensitivity of \$\$88.79\textbackslash\%\$\$, precision of \$\$71.50\textbackslash\%\$\$, and F1-Score of \$\$79.21\textbackslash\%\$\$for the DIARETDB1 data set Kalviainen and Uusutalo (Medical Image Understanding and Analysis, Citeseer, 2007). It outperforms the state-of-the-art networks such as U-Net Ronneberger et al. (International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, Springer, 2015)~and attention U-Net~Oktay et al. (Attention u-net: Learning where to look for the pancreas, 2018).},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automatic retina verification framework based on the biometric graph matching (BGM) algorithm. The retinal vasculature is extracted using a family of matched filters in the frequency domain and morphological operators. Then, retinal templates are defined as formal spatial graphs derived from the retinal vasculature. The BGM algorithm, a noisy graph matching algorithm, robust to translation, non-linear distortion, and small rotations, is used to compare retinal templates. The BGM algorithm uses graph topology to define three distance measures between a pair of graphs, two of which are new. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to distinguish between genuine and imposter comparisons. Using single as well as multiple graph measures, the classifier achieves complete separation on a training set of images from the VARIA database (60\% of the data), equaling the state-of-the-art for retina verification. Because the available data set is small, kernel density estimation (KDE) of the genuine and imposter score distributions of the training set are used to measure performance of the BGM algorithm. In the one dimensional case, the KDE model is validated with the testing set. A 0 EER on testing shows that the KDE model is a good fit for the empirical distribution. For the multiple graph measures, a novel combination of the SVM boundary and the KDE model is used to obtain a fair comparison with the KDE model for the single measure. A clear benefit in using multiple graph measures over a single measure to distinguish genuine and imposter comparisons is demonstrated by a drop in theoretical error of between 60\% and more than two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nonmydriatic fundus photography by non-ophthalmic-trained personnel has recently been shown to be a potential alternative to direct ophthalmoscopy in the emergency department (ED). We evaluated the reliability of a novel quality rating scale and applied this scale to nonmydriatic fundus photographs taken during routine ED patient encounters to determine factors associated with diminished photograph quality. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: We included 350 patients enrolled in the Fundus photography versus Ophthalmoscopy Trials Outcomes in the Emergency Department study who were photographed by nurse practitioners after {$<$}30 minutes of training followed by supervision. METHODS: Photographs of both eyes were graded for quality on 2 occasions by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists. Four regions were independently evaluated for quality: Optic disc, macula, and superior and inferior vascular arcades. Quality as a function of the number of photographs taken was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Mixed effects ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate for predictors of image quality while accounting for the repeated measures design. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall photographic quality (1-5 scale; 5 best). RESULTS: We evaluated 1734 photographs. Inter- and intraobserver agreements between neuro-ophthalmologists were very good (weighted kappa, 0.84-0.87). Quality of the optic disc area was better than those of other retinal areas (P{$<$}0.002). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that if a high-quality photograph of an eye was not obtained by the third attempt, it was unlikely that one would be obtained at all. A 10-second increase in the interphotograph interval before a total of 40 seconds increased the odds of a 1-unit higher quality rating by 1.81 times (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-1.98), and a 10-year increase in age decreased the odds by 0.76 times (95\% CI, 0.69-0.85). Black patients had 0.42 times (95\% CI, 0.28-0.63) the odds of a 1-unit higher quality rating compared with whites. CONCLUSIONS: Our 5-point scale is a reliable measure of nonmydriatic photograph quality. The region of interest, interphotograph interval, and patient age and race are significant predictors of image quality for nonmydriatic photographs taken by nurse practitioners in the ED. Addressing these factors may have a direct impact on the successful implementation of nonmydriatic fundus photography into the ED.},

Recent findings~         Once thought of as a disease of the West, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing at alarming rates in many other areas of the world. In recent years, significant attention has been placed on the growing Asian diabetes epidemic. As a result, the medical community has come to understand that previously defined risk factors, particularly BMI, may not be applicable to the global community. The heterogeneity of the disease has been demonstrated both through anthropometric and genetic studies. Despite this heterogeneity, some treatments, particularly lifestyle interventions, have been found to have an ethnic nonspecific positive impact on the disease.         Summary~         Diabetes promises to become an even larger public health issue with significant social and economic burden with clinical practice and public health policy implications. Further population studies and identification of ethnic specific risk factors will guide research to develop a better understanding of the disease.},

However, there is an increasing demand for high-resolution imaging of ocular tissues to improve the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides important additional information about the retina. It produces reliable, reproducible and objective retinal images especially in diabetic macular edema and provides information about vitreoretinal relationships that can clearly only be detected with OCT. It enhances the ability to exactly diagnose diabetic macular edema, epiretinal membranes, vitreomacular or vitroretinal traction. OCT also brings new insights into morphological changes of the retina in diabetic retinopathy. It demonstrates that macular edema is a complex clinical entity with various morphology. With the OCT, structural changes and quantitative assessment of macular edema have become feasible as determined with retinal thickness and volume. OCT is more sensitive to small changes in retinal thickness than slit-lamp biomicroscopy.},

  abstract = {Purpose To establish whether deep learning methods are able to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of time-domain (TD) OCT images to approach that of spectral-domain (SD) OCT images. Design Method agreement study and progression detection in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for open-angle glaucoma (OAG), the United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study (UKGTS). Participants The training and validation cohort comprised 77 stable OAG participants with TD OCT and SD OCT imaging at up to 11 visits within 3 months. The testing cohort comprised 284 newly diagnosed OAG patients with TD OCT images from a cohort of 516 recruited at 10 United Kingdom centers between 2007 and~2010. Methods An ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs) was trained on TD OCT and SD OCT image pairs from the training dataset and applied to TD OCT images from the testing dataset. Time-domain OCT images were converted to synthesized SD OCT images and segmented via Bayesian fusion on the output of the GANs. Main Outcome Measures Bland-Altman analysis assessed agreement between TD OCT and synthesized SD OCT average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements and the SD OCT RNFLT. Analysis of the distribution of the rates of RNFLT change in TD OCT and synthesized SD OCT in the two treatment arms of the UKGTS was compared. A Cox model for predictors of time-to-incident visual field (VF) progression was computed with the TD OCT and the synthesized SD OCT images. Results The 95\% limits of agreement were between TD OCT and SD OCT were 26.64 to –22.95; between synthesized SD OCT and SD OCT were 8.11 to –6.73; and between SD OCT and SD OCT were 4.16 to –4.04. The mean difference in the rate of RNFLT change between UKGTS treatment and placebo arms with TD OCT was 0.24 (P~= 0.11) and with synthesized SD OCT was 0.43 (P~= 0.0017). The hazard ratio for RNFLT slope in Cox regression modeling for time to incident VF progression was 1.09 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.21; P~=~0.035) for TD OCT and 1.24 (95\% CI, 1.08–1.39; P~= 0.011) for synthesized SD OCT. Conclusions Image enhancement significantly improved the agreement of TD OCT RNFLT measurements with SD OCT RNFLT measurements. The difference, and its significance, in rates of RNFLT change in the UKGTS treatment arms was enhanced and RNFLT change became a stronger predictor of VF progression.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

  abstract = {Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has revolutionized ophthalmology. Since its introduction in the early 1990s it has continuously improved in terms of speed, resolution and sensitivity. The technique has also seen a variety of extensions aiming to assess functional aspects of the tissue in addition to morphology. One of these approaches is Doppler OCT (DOCT), which aims to visualize and quantify blood flow. Such extensions were already implemented in time domain systems, but have gained importance with the introduction of Fourier domain OCT. Nowadays phase-sensitive detection techniques are most widely used to extract blood velocity and blood flow from tissues. A common problem with the technique is that the Doppler angle is not known and several approaches have been realized to obtain absolute velocity and flow data from the retina. Additional studies are required to elucidate which of these techniques is most promising. In the recent years, however, several groups have shown that data can be obtained with high validity and reproducibility. In addition, several groups have published values for total retinal blood flow. Another promising application relates to non-invasive angiography. As compared to standard techniques such as fluorescein and indocyanine-green angiography the technique offers two major advantages: no dye is required and depth resolution is required is provided. As such Doppler OCT has the potential to improve our abilities to diagnose and monitor ocular vascular diseases.},

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has been a valuable diagnostic tool for DME, which is among the most common causes of irreversible vision loss in individuals with diabetes. Here, a classification framework with five distinctive steps is proposed and we present an extensive study of each step. Our method considers combination of various preprocessing steps in conjunction with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) features and different mapping strategies. Using linear and nonlinear classifiers, we tested the developed framework on a balanced cohort of 32 patients. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous studies by achieving a Sensitivity (SE) and a Specificity (SP) of 81.2\% and 93.7\%, respectively. Our study concludes that the 3D features and high-level representation of 2D features using patches achieve the best results. However, the effects of preprocessing are inconsistent with different classifiers and feature configurations.},

  abstract = {Analysis of retinal fundus images is essential for eye-care physicians in the diagnosis, care and treatment of patients. Accurate fundus and/or retinal vessel maps give rise to longitudinal studies able to utilize multimedia image registration and disease/condition status measurements, as well as applications in surgery preparation and biometrics. The segmentation of retinal morphology has numerous applications in assessing ophthalmologic and cardiovascular disease pathologies. Computer-aided segmentation of the vasculature has proven to be a challenge, mainly due to inconsistencies such as noise and variations in hue and brightness that can greatly reduce the quality of fundus images. The goal of this work is to collate different key performance indicators (KPIs) and state-of-the-art methods applied to this task, frame computational efficiency\&ndash;performance trade-offs under varying degrees of information loss using common datasets, and introduce PixelBNN, a highly efficient deep method for automating the segmentation of fundus morphologies. The model was trained, tested and cross tested on the DRIVE, STARE and CHASE\_DB1 retinal vessel segmentation datasets. Performance was evaluated using G-mean, Mathews Correlation Coefficient and F1-score, with the main success measure being computation speed. The network was 8.5\&times; faster than the current state-of-the-art at test time and performed comparatively well, considering a 5\&times; to 19\&times; reduction in information from resizing images during preprocessing.},

  abstract = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) take all the image patches as tokens and construct multi-head self-attention (MHSA) among them. Complete leverage of these image tokens brings redundant computations since not all the tokens are attentive in MHSA. Examples include that tokens containing semantically meaningless or distractive image backgrounds do not positively contribute to the ViT predictions. In this work, we propose to reorganize image tokens during the feed-forward process of ViT models, which is integrated into ViT during training. For each forward inference, we identify the attentive image tokens between MHSA and FFN (i.e., feed-forward network) modules, which is guided by the corresponding class token attention. Then, we reorganize image tokens by preserving attentive image tokens and fusing inattentive ones to expedite subsequent MHSA and FFN computations. To this end, our method EViT improves ViTs from two perspectives. First, under the same amount of input image tokens, our method reduces MHSA and FFN computation for efficient inference. For instance, the inference speed of DeiT-S is increased by 50\% while its recognition accuracy is decreased by only 0.3\% for ImageNet classification. Second, by maintaining the same computational cost, our method empowers ViTs to take more image tokens as input for recognition accuracy improvement, where the image tokens are from higher resolution images. An example is that we improve the recognition accuracy of DeiT-S by 1\% for ImageNet classification at the same computational cost of a vanilla DeiT-S. Meanwhile, our method does not introduce more parameters to ViTs. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness globally. Performing retinal examinations on all diabetic patients is an unmet need, and detection at an early stage can provide better control of the disease. The objective of this study is to provide an optical coherence tomography (OCT) image based diagnostic technology for automated early DR diagnosis, including at both grades 0 and 1. This work can help ophthalmologists with evaluation and treatment, reducing the rate of vision loss, and enabling timely and accurate diagnosis. In this work, we developed and evaluated a novel deep network – OCTD\_Net, for early-stage DR detection. While one of the networks extracted features from the original OCT image, the other extracted retinal layer information. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was 0.92, 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. Our analysis of retinal layers and the features learned by the proposed network suggests that grade 1 DR patients present with significant changes in the thickness and reflection of certain retinal layers. However, grade 0 DR patients do not have such significant changes. The heatmaps of the trained network also suggest that patients with early DR showed different textures around the myoid and ellipsoid zones, inner nuclear layers, and photoreceptor outer segments, which should all receive dedicated attention for early DR diagnosis.},

  abstract = {To automate the segmentation of retinal layers, we propose DeepRetina, a method based on deep neural networks.    DeepRetina uses the improved Xception65 to extract and learn the characteristics of retinal layers. The Xception65-extracted feature maps are inputted to an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module to obtain multiscale feature information. This information is then recovered to capture clearer retinal layer boundaries in the encoder-decoder module, thus completing retinal layer auto-segmentation of the retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.    We validated this method using a retinal OCT image database containing 280 volumes (40 B-scans per volume) to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results showed that the method exhibits excellent performance in terms of the mean intersection over union and sensitivity (Se), which are as high as 90.41 and 92.15\%, respectively. The intersection over union and Se values of the nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, outer limiting membrane, photoreceptor inner segment, photoreceptor outer segment, and pigment epithelium layer were found to be above 88\%.    DeepRetina can automate the segmentation of retinal layers and has great potential for the early diagnosis of fundus retinal diseases. In addition, our approach will provide a segmentation model framework for other types of tissues and cells in clinical practice.    Automating the segmentation of retinal layers can help effectively diagnose and monitor clinical retinal diseases. In addition, it requires only a small amount of manual segmentation, significantly improving work efficiency.}

A series of automated deep-learning-based algorithms for DR screening have been proposed and achieved high sensitivity and specificity (\,{$>$}\,90\%). However, these deep learning models do not perform well in clinical applications due to the limitations of the existing publicly available fundus image datasets. In order to evaluate these methods in clinical situations, we collected 13,673 fundus images from 9598 patients. These images were divided into six classes by seven graders according to image quality and DR level. Moreover, 757 images with DR were selected to annotate four types of DR-related lesions. Finally, we evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on collected images, including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Although we obtain an accuracy of 0.8284 for DR classification, these algorithms perform poorly on lesion segmentation and detection, indicating that lesion segmentation and detection are quite challenging. In summary, we are providing a new dataset named DDR for assessing deep learning models and further exploring the clinical applications, particularly for lesion recognition.},

  abstract = {The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a “new normal”, the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions.},

  abstract = {Purpose To assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm for detecting referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) based on color fundus photographs. Design A deep learning system for the classification of GON was developed for automated classification of GON on color fundus photographs. Participants We retrospectively included 48\,116 fundus photographs for the development and validation of a deep learning algorithm. Methods This study recruited 21 trained ophthalmologists to classify the photographs. Referable GON was defined as vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more and other typical changes of GON. The reference standard was made until 3 graders achieved agreement. A separate validation dataset of 8000 fully gradable fundus photographs was used to assess the performance of this algorithm. Main Outcome Measures The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with sensitivity and specificity was applied to evaluate the efficacy of the deep learning algorithm detecting referable GON. Results In the validation dataset, this deep learning system achieved an AUC of 0.986 with sensitivity of 95.6\% and specificity of 92.0\%. The most common reasons for false-negative grading (n~= 87) were GON with coexisting eye conditions (n~= 44 [50.6\%]), including pathologic or high myopia (n~= 37 [42.6\%]), diabetic retinopathy (n~= 4 [4.6\%]), and age-related macular degeneration (n~= 3 [3.4\%]). The leading reason for false-positive results (n~= 480) was having other eye conditions (n~= 458 [95.4\%]), mainly including physiologic cupping (n~=~267 [55.6\%]). Misclassification as false-positive results amidst a normal-appearing fundus occurred in only 22 eyes (4.6\%). Conclusions A deep learning system can detect referable GON with high sensitivity and specificity. Coexistence of high or pathologic myopia is the most common cause resulting in false-negative results. Physiologic cupping and pathologic myopia were the most common reasons for false-positive results.},

Our key insight is to build a projection learning module (PLM) which uses a unidirectional pooling layer to conduct effective features selection and dimension reduction concurrently. By combining multiple PLMs, the proposed network can input 3D OCTA data, and output 2D segmentation results such as retinal vessel segmentation. It provides a new idea for the quantification of retinal indicators: without retinal layer segmentation and without projection maps. We tested the performance of our network for two crucial retinal image segmentation issues: retinal vessel (RV) segmentation and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) segmentation. The experimental results on 316 OCTA volumes demonstrate that the IPN is an effective implementation of 3D-to-2D segmentation networks, and the uses of multi-modality information and volumetric information make IPN perform better than the baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to the automatic analysis of medical images for disease diagnosis and to help human experts by efficiently processing immense amounts of images. While the handcrafted feature has been used for eye disease detection or classification since the 1990s, DNN was recently adopted in this area and showed a very promising performance. Since handcrafted and deep feature can extract complementary information, we propose, in this paper, three different integration frameworks to combine handcrafted and deep feature for optical coherence tomography image-based eye disease classification. In addition, to integrate the handcrafted feature at the input and fully connected layers using existing networks, such as VGG, DenseNet, and Xception, a novel ribcage network (RC Net) is also proposed for feature integration at middle layers. For RC Net, two “rib” channels are designed to independently process deep and handcrafted features, and another so-called “spine” channel is designed for the integration. While dense blocks are the main components of the three channels, sum operation is proposed for the feature map integration. Our experimental results showed that the deep networks achieved better classification accuracy after the integration of the handcrafted features, e.g., scale-invariant feature transform and Gabor. The RC Net showed the best performance among all the proposed feature integration methods.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have been well-known for their superb performance in handling various machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. However, due to their over-parameterized black-box nature, it is often difficult to understand the prediction results of deep models. In recent years, many interpretation tools have been proposed to explain or reveal the ways that deep models make decisions. In this paper, we review this line of research and try to make a comprehensive survey. Specifically, we introduce and clarify two basic concepts-interpretations and interpretability-that people usually get confused. First of all, to address the research efforts in interpretations, we elaborate the design of several recent interpretation algorithms, from different perspectives, through proposing a new taxonomy. Then, to understand the results of interpretation, we also survey the performance metrics for evaluating interpretation algorithms. Further, we summarize the existing work in evaluating models' interpretability using "trustworthy" interpretation algorithms. Finally, we review and discuss the connections between deep models' interpretations and other factors, such as adversarial robustness and data augmentations, and we introduce several open-source libraries for interpretation algorithms and evaluation approaches.},

However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into “black box” approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.},

The proposed method effectively predicts the whole spatial-temporal evolution of the typhoon clouds, resulting in a visual complement for classic typhoon prediction methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated in the real satellite cloud images.},

The goal is to identify the presence of normal macula and each of three types of macular pathologies, namely, macular edema, macular hole, and age-related macular degeneration, in the OCT slice centered at the fovea. We use a machine learning approach based on global image descriptors formed from a multi-scale spatial pyramid. Our local features are dimension-reduced local binary pattern histograms, which are capable of encoding texture and shape information in retinal OCT images and their edge maps, respectively. Our representation operates at multiple spatial scales and granularities, leading to robust performance. We use 2-class support vector machine classifiers to identify the presence of normal macula and each of the three pathologies. To further discriminate sub-types within a pathology, we also build a classifier to differentiate full-thickness holes from pseudo-holes within the macular hole category. We conduct extensive experiments on a large dataset of 326 OCT scans from 136 subjects. The results show that the proposed method is very effective (all AUC{$>$}0.93).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting selfattention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (86.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The code and models will be made publicly available at https:// github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixelsto-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves stateof-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

General-purpose edge detection algorithms often fail to segment the optic disk due to fuzzy boundaries, inconsistent image contrast or missing edge features. This paper presents an algorithm for the localization and segmentation of the optic nerve head boundary in low-resolution images (about 20µ per pixel). Optic disk localization is achieved using specialized template matching, and segmentation by a deformable contour model. The latter uses a global elliptical model and a local deformable model with variable edge-strength dependent stiffness. The algorithm is evaluated against a randomly-selected database of 100 images from a diabetic screening programme. Ten images were classified as unusable; the others were of highly variable quality. The localization algorithm succeeded on all bar one usable image; the contour estimation algorithm was qualitatively assessed by an ophthalmologist as having Excellent, Good or Fair performance in 83\% of cases, and performs well even on blurred images.},

These images can help reveal disease-related alterations below the surface of the retina, such as the presence of edema, or accumulation of fluid which can distort vision, and are an indication of disruptions in the vasculature of the retina. In this paper, a new framework is proposed for multiclass fluid segmentation and detection in the retinal OCT images. Based on the intensity of OCT images and retinal layer segmentations provided by a graph-cut algorithm, a fully convolutional neural network was trained to recognize and label the fluid pixels. Random forest classification was performed on the segmented fluid regions to detect and reject the falsely labeled fluid regions. The proposed framework won the first place in the MICCAI RETOUCH challenge in 2017 on both the segmentation performance (mean Dice: 0.7667) and the detection performance (mean AUC: 1.00) tasks.},

We show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks: width-(n + 4) ReLU networks, where n is the input dimension, are universal approximators.

We show that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other hand, we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and shallow network with high accuracy.

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

We introduce the notion of an effective receptive field, and show that it both has a Gaussian distribution and only occupies a fraction of the full theoretical receptive field. We analyze the effective receptive field in several architecture designs, and the effect of nonlinear activations, dropout, sub-sampling and skip connections on it. This leads to suggestions for ways to address its tendency to be too small.},

  abstract = {© Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Conference Track Proceedings.All right reserved. Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data and yet classified incorrectly by the network. To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against a well-defined class of adversaries. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest robustness against a first-order adversary as a natural security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that flaws in machine learning (ML) algorithm validation are an underestimated global problem. Particularly in automatic biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, our large international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics. Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was developed in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of a problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain interest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm output. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that can be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level, namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of access to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the most common validation metrics. The broad applicability of our framework across domains is demonstrated by an instantiation for various biological and medical image analysis use cases.},

To better comprehend these opaque procedures, a convolutional neural network for optical coherence tomography image segmentation was enhanced with a Traceable Relevance Explainability (T-REX) technique. The proposed application was based on three components: ground truth generation by multiple graders, calculation of Hamming distances among graders and the machine learning algorithm, as well as a smart data visualization (‘neural recording’). An overall average variability of 1.75\% between the human graders and the algorithm was found, slightly minor to 2.02\% among human graders. The ambiguity in ground truth had noteworthy impact on machine learning results, which could be visualized. The convolutional neural network balanced between graders and allowed for modifiable predictions dependent on the compartment. Using the proposed T-REX setup, machine learning processes could be rendered more transparent and understandable, possibly leading to optimized applications.},

Developing an artificial intelligence system that can automatically make lab test imputations and medication recommendations can save cost on potentially redundant lab tests and inform physicians in more effective prescription. We present an intelligent model that can automatically recommend the patients' medications based on their incomplete lab tests, and can even accurately estimate the lab values that have not been taken. We model the complex relations between multiple types of medical entities with their inherent features in a heterogeneous graph. Then we learn a distributed representation for each entity in the graph based on graph convolutional networks to make the representations integrate information from multiple types of entities. Since the entity representations incorporate multiple types of medical information, they can be used for multiple medical tasks. In our experiments, we construct a graph to associate patients, encounters, lab tests and medications, and conduct the two tasks: medication recommendation and lab test imputation. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art models in both tasks.},

The retina is the most important part of forming visual images, which is a thin layer of tissue situated at the backside wall of the eye. These diseases can be identified accurately from SD-OCT scanned images. OCT is a non-contact imaging technology that is used to detect abnormalities among retinal layers. Currently, the classification performed by an ophthalmologist is relatively time consuming. Among the several retinal OCT classification techniques, a recent advancement is deep learning techniques for retinal image classification. Among the deep learning models used is the convolutional neural network (CNN), which can instinctively learn a series of hierarchical features. Therefore, the proposed method uses a variety of standard spatial convolution, which is depthwise separable convolution (DSC). DSC reduces the complexity of the network by reducing trainable parameters and by reducing time and space complexity. The method was tested on the public dataset OCT2017. Experimental results show the proposed method gives a promising result with better execution time compared to the standard CNN.},

Due to the three-dimensionality and complexity of the images, manual analysis of pathological features is difficult, time-consuming, and prone to subjectivity. Computer analysis of 3D OCT images is necessary to enable automated quantitative measuring of the features, objectively and repeatedly. As supervised and semi-supervised learning-based automatic segmentation depends on the training data and quality of annotations, we have created a new database of annotated retinal OCT images – the AROI database. It consists of 1136 images with annotations for pathological changes (fluid accumulation and related findings) and basic structures (layers) in patients with AMD. Inter- and intra-observer errors have been calculated in order to enable the validation of developed algorithms in relation to human variability. Also, we have performed the automatic segmentation with standard U-net architecture and two state-of-the-art architectures for medical image segmentation to set a baseline for further algorithm development and to get insight into challenges for automatic segmentation. To facilitate and encourage further research in the field, we have made the AROI database openly available.},

The new model allows the extension of the input domain for supervised neural networks to a general class of graphs including both acyclic/cyclic, directed/undirected labeled graphs. In particular, the model can realize adaptive contextual transductions, learning the mapping from graphs for both classification and regression tasks. In contrast to previous neural networks for structures that had a recursive dynamics, NN4G is based on a constructive feedforward architecture with state variables that uses neurons with no feedback connections. The neurons are applied to the input graphs by a general traversal process that relaxes the constraints of previous approaches derived by the causality assumption over hierarchical input data. Moreover, the incremental approach eliminates the need to introduce cyclic dependencies in the definition of the system state variables. In the traversal process, the NN4G units exploit (local) contextual information of the graphs vertices. In spite of the simplicity of the approach, we show that, through the compositionality of the contextual information developed by the learning, the model can deal with contextual information that is incrementally extended according to the graphs topology. The effectiveness and the generality of the new approach are investigated by analyzing its theoretical properties and providing experimental results.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows us to identify, into retinal layers, new morphological entities, which can be considered clinical biomarkers of retinal diseases. According to the literature, solitary, small ({$<$}30 µm), medium level hyperreflective (similar to retinal fiber layer) retinal foci (HRF) may represent aggregates of activated microglial cells and an in vivo biomarker of retinal inflammation. The identification and quantification of this imaging biomarker allows for estimating the level and possibly the amount of intraretinal inflammation in major degenerative retinal disorders, whose inflammatory component has already been demonstrated (diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, radiation retinopathy). Currently, diabetic retinopathy (DR) probably represents the best clinical model to apply this analysis in the definition of this clinical biomarker. However, the main limitation to the clinical use of HRF is related to the technical difficulty of counting them: a time-consuming methodology, which also needs trained examiners. To contribute to solve this limitation, we developed and validated a new method for the semi-automatic detection of HRF in OCT scans. OCT scans of patients affected by DR, were analyzed. HRF were manually counted in High Resolution spectral domain OCT images. Then, the same OCT scans underwent semi-automatic HRF counting, using an ImageJ software with four different settings profiles. Statistical analysis showed an excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the manual count and each of the four semi-automated methods. The use of the second setting profile allows to obtain at the Bland–Altman graph a bias of −0.2 foci and a limit of agreement of ±16.3 foci. This validation approach opens the way not only to the reliable and daily clinical applicable quantification of HRF, but also to a better knowledge of the inflammatory component—including its progression and regression changes—of diabetic retinopathy.},

Even though AI-powered systems have brought competitive advantages, the black-box nature makes them lack transparency and prevents them from explaining their decisions. This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI. After offering the readers a solid XAI background, we analyze and review various XAI methods, which are grouped into (i) pre-modeling explainability, (ii) interpretable model, and (iii) post-modeling explainability. We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods. In addition, we systematically discuss various XAI challenges, such as the trade-off between the performance and the explainability, evaluation methods, security, and policy. Finally, we show the standard approaches that are leveraged to deal with the mentioned challenges.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a multimodal multiresolution graph- based method to segment the top surface of the retina called the inter- nal limiting membrane (ILM) within optic-nerve-head-centered spectral- domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volumes. Having a pre- cise ILM surface is crucial as this surface is utilized for measuring several structural parameters such as Bruch's membrane opening-minimum rim width (BMO-MRW) and cup volume. The proposed method addresses the common current segmentation errors due to the presence of retinal blood vessels, deep cupping, or a very steep slope of the ILM. In order to resolve these issues, the volume is resampled using a set of gradient vector flow (GVF) based columns. The GVF field is computed according to an initial surface segmentation which is obtained through a multires- olution framework. The retinal blood vessel information (obtained from corresponding registered fundus photographs) along with shape prior in- formation are incorporated in a graph-theoretic approach to compute the ILM segmentation. The method is tested on the SD-OCT volumes from 44 glaucoma subjects and significantly smaller errors were obtained than that from current approaches.},

  abstract = {With availability of different retinal imaging modalities such as fundus photography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), having a robust and accurate registration scheme to enable utilization of this complementary information is beneficial. The few existing fundus-OCT registration approaches contain a vessel segmentation step, as the retinal blood vessels are the most dominant structures that are in common between the pair of images. However, errors in the vessel segmentation from either modality may cause corresponding errors in the registration. In this paper, we propose a feature-based registration method for registering fundus photographs and SD-OCT projection images that benefits from vasculature structural information without requiring blood vessel segmentation. In particular, after a preprocessing step, a set of control points (CPs) are identified by looking for the corners in the images. Next, each CP is represented by a feature vector which encodes the local structural information via computing the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) from the neighborhood of each CP. The best matching CPs are identified by calculating the distance of their corresponding feature vectors. After removing the incorrect matches the best affine transform that registers fundus photographs to SD-OCT projection images is computed using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) method. The proposed method was tested on 44 pairs of fundus and SD-OCT projection images of glaucoma patients and the result showed that the proposed method successfully registers the multimodal images and produced a registration error of 25.34 ± 12.34 μm (0.84 ± 0.41 pixels).},

  abstract = {In this work, a multimodal approach is proposed to use the complementary information from fundus photographs and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volumes in order to segment the optic disc and cup boundaries. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the optimal solution is obtained using a machine-learning theoretical graph-based method. In particular, first the fundus photograph is registered to the 2D projection of the SD-OCT volume. Three in-region cost functions are designed using a random forest classifier corresponding to three regions of cup, rim, and background. Next, the volumes are resampled to create radial scans in which the Bruch's Membrane Opening (BMO) endpoints are easier to detect. Similar to in-region cost function design, the disc-boundary cost function is designed using a random forest classifier for which the features are created by applying the Haar Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to the radial projection image. A multisurface graph-based approach utilizes the in-region and disc-boundary cost images to segment the boundaries of optic disc and cup under feasibility constraints. The approach is evaluated on 25 multimodal image pairs from 25 subjects in a leave-one-out fashion (by subject). The performances of the graph-theoretic approach using three sets of cost functions are compared: 1) using unimodal (OCT only) in-region costs, 2) using multimodal in-region costs, and 3) using multimodal in-region and disc-boundary costs. Results show that the multimodal approaches outperform the unimodal approach in segmenting the optic disc and cup.},

Our approach unifies the dual-attention mechanism at multi-levels of the pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN). It provides a focused learning mechanism by taking into account both multi-level features based attention focusing on the salient coarser features and self-attention mechanism attending higher entropy regions of the finer features. Our proposed method enables the network to automatically focus on the relevant parts of the input images at different levels of feature subspaces. This leads to a more locally deformation-aware feature generation and classification. The proposed approach does not require pre-processing steps such as extraction of region of interest, denoising, and retinal flattening, making the network more robust and fully automatic. Experimental results on two macular OCT databases show the superior performance of our proposed approach as compared to the current state-of-the-art methodologies.},

  abstract = {The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in everyday life. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are intended to self-explain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

Although these methods perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method called deep Taylor decomposition efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer. We evaluate the proposed method empirically on the MNIST and ILSVRC data sets.},

A prerequisite is however for the model to be able to explain itself, e.g. by highlighting which input features it uses to support its prediction. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique that brings such explainability and scales to potentially highly complex deep neural networks. It operates by propagating the prediction backward in the neural network, using a set of purposely designed propagation rules. In this chapter, we give a concise introduction to LRP with a discussion of (1) how to implement propagation rules easily and efficiently, (2) how the propagation procedure can be theoretically justified as a ‘deep Taylor decomposition’, (3) how to choose the propagation rules at each layer to deliver high explanation quality, and (4) how LRP can be extended to handle a variety of machine learning scenarios beyond deep neural networks.},

  abstract = {Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is an irreversible and chronic medical condition characterized by drusen, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) and Geographic Atrophy (GA). AMD is one of the major causes of visual loss among elderly people. It is caused by the degeneration of cells in the macula which is responsible for central vision. AMD can be dry or wet type, however dry AMD is most common. It is classified into early, intermediate and late AMD. The early detection and treatment may help one to stop the progression of the disease. Automated AMD diagnosis may reduce the screening time of the clinicians. In this work, we have introduced LCP to characterize normal and AMD classes using fundus images. Linear Configuration Coefficients (CC) and Pattern Occurrence (PO) features are extracted from fundus images. These extracted features are ranked using p-value of the t-test and fed to various supervised classifiers viz. Decision Tree (DT), Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify normal and AMD classes. The performance of the system is evaluated using both private (Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India) and public domain datasets viz. Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) and STructured Analysis of the Retina (STARE) using ten-fold cross validation. The proposed approach yielded best performance with a highest average accuracy of 97.78\%, sensitivity of 98.00\% and specificity of 97.50\% for STARE dataset using 22 significant features. Hence, this system can be used as an aiding tool to the clinicians during mass eye screening programs to diagnose AMD.},

  abstract = {Meteorological radar is a remote sensing system that provides rainfall estimations at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The radar-based rainfall intensities (R) are calculated from the observed radar reflectivities (Z ). Often, rain gauge rainfall observations are used in combination with the radar data to find the optimal parameters in the Z–R transformation equation. The scale dependency of the power-law Z–R parameters when estimated from radar reflectivity and rain gauge intensity data is explored herein. The multiplicative (a) and exponent (b) parameters are said to be ‘‘scale dependent’’ if applying the observed and calculated rainfall intensities to objective function at different scale results in different ‘‘optimal’’ parameters. Radar and gauge data were analyzed from convective storms over a midsize, semiarid, and well-equipped watershed. Using the root-mean-square difference (rmsd) objective function, a significant scale dependency was observed. Increased time- and space scales resulted in a considerable increase of the a parameter and decrease of the b parameter. Two sources of uncertainties related to scale dependency were examined: 1) observational uncertainties, which were studied both experimentally and with simplified models that allow representation of observation errors; and 2) model uncertainties. It was found that observational errors are mainly (but not only) associated with positive bias of the b parameter that is reduced with integration, at least for small scales. Model errors also result in scale dependency, but the trend is less systematic, as in the case of observational errors. It is concluded that identification of optimal scale for Z–R relationship determination requires further knowledge of reflectivity and rainintensity error structure.},

  abstract = {The present study aimed to conduct a real-time automatic analysis of two important surgical phases, which are continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC), nuclear extraction, and three other surgical phases of cataract surgery using artificial intelligence technology. A total of 303 cases of cataract surgery registered in the clinical database of the Ophthalmology Department of Tsukazaki Hospital were used as a dataset. Surgical videos were downsampled to a resolution of 299\,×\,168 at 1 FPS to image each frame. Next, based on the start and end times of each surgical phase recorded by an ophthalmologist, the obtained images were labeled correctly. Using the data, a neural network model, known as InceptionV3, was developed to identify the given surgical phase for each image. Then, the obtained images were processed in chronological order using the neural network model, where the moving average of the output result of five consecutive images was derived. The class with the maximum output value was defined as the surgical phase. For each surgical phase, the time at which a phase was first identified was defined as the start time, and the time at which a phase was last identified was defined as the end time. The performance was evaluated by finding the mean absolute error between the start and end times of each important phase recorded by the ophthalmologist as well as the start and end times determined by the model. The correct response rate of the cataract surgical phase classification was 90.7\% for CCC, 94.5\% for nuclear extraction, and 97.9\% for other phases, with a mean correct response rate of 96.5\%. The errors between each phase’s start and end times recorded by the ophthalmologist and those determined by the neural network model were as follows: CCC’s start and end times, 3.34\,seconds and 4.43\,seconds, respectively and nuclear extraction’s start and end times, 7.21\,seconds and 6.04\,seconds, respectively, with a mean of 5.25\,seconds. The neural network model used in this study was able to perform the classification of the surgical phase by only referring to the last 5\,seconds of video images. Therefore, our method has performed like a real-time classification.},

  abstract = {Millions of people are affected by retinal abnormalities worldwide. Early detection and treatment of these abnormalities could arrest further progression, saving multitudes from avoidable blindness. Manual disease detection is time-consuming, tedious and lacks repeatability. There have been efforts to automate ocular disease detection, riding on the successes of the application of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). These models have performed well, however, there remain challenges owing to the complex nature of retinal lesions. This work reviews the most common retinal pathologies, provides an overview of prevalent imaging modalities and presents a critical evaluation of current deep-learning research for the detection and grading of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, Age-Related Macular Degeneration and multiple retinal diseases. The work concluded that CAD, through deep learning, will increasingly be vital as an assistive technology. As future work, there is a need to explore the potential impact of using ensemble CNN architectures in multiclass, multilabel tasks. Efforts should also be expended on the improvement of model explainability to win the trust of clinicians and patients.},

  abstract = {Purpose Existing summary statistics based upon optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and/or visual fields (VF) are suboptimal for distinguishing between healthy and glaucomatous eyes in the clinic. This study evaluates the extent to which a hybrid deep learning method (HDLM), combined with a single wide-field OCT protocol, can distinguish eyes previously classified as either healthy suspects or mild glaucoma. Patients and Methods 102 eyes from 102 patients, with or suspected open-angle glaucoma, had previously been classified by two glaucoma experts as either glaucomatous (57 eyes) or healthy/suspects (45 eyes). The HDLM had access only to information from a single, wide-field (9×12mm) swept-source OCT scan per patient. Convolutional neural networks were used to extract rich features from maps derived from these scans. Random forest classifier was used to train a model based on these features to predict the existence of glaucomatous damage. The algorithm was compared against traditional OCT and VF metrics. Results The accuracy of the HDLM ranged from 63.7\% to 93.1\% depending upon the input map. The RNFL probability map had the best accuracy (93.1\%), with 4 false positives, and 3 false negatives. In comparison, the accuracy of the OCT and 24-2 and 10-2 VF metrics ranged from 66.7\% to 87.3\%. The OCT quadrants analysis had the best accuracy (87.3\%) of the metrics, with 4 FP and 9 FN. Conclusion The HDLM protocol outperforms standard OCT and VF clinical metrics in distinguishing healthy suspect eyes from eyes with early glaucoma. It should be possible to further improve this algorithm and with improvement it might be useful for screening},

  abstract = {Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes mellitus, which if left untreated may lead to complete vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to prevent further complications of DR. Computer-aided diagnosis is a very effective method to support ophthalmologists, as manual inspection of pathological changes in retina images are time consuming and expensive. In recent times, Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques have subsided conventional rule based approaches for detection, segmentation and classification of DR stages and lesions in fundus images. Method: In this paper, we present a comparative study of the different state-of-the-art preprocessing methods that have been used in deep learning based DR classification tasks in recent times and also propose a new unsupervised learning based retinal region extraction technique and new combinations of preprocessing pipelines designed on top of it. Efficacy of different existing and new combinations of the preprocessing methods are analyzed using two publicly available retinal datasets (EyePACS and APTOS) for different DR stage classification tasks, such as referable DR, DR screening, and five-class DR grading, using a benchmark deep learning model (ResNet-50). Results: It has been observed that the proposed preprocessing strategy composed of region of interest extraction through K-means clustering followed by contrast and edge enhancement using Graham’s method and z-score intensity normalization achieved the highest accuracy of 98.5\%, 96.51\% and 90.59\% in DR-screening, referable-DR, and DR gradation tasks respectively and also achieved the best quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.945 in DR grading task. It achieved best AUC-ROC of 0.98 and 0.9981 in DR grading and DR screening tasks respectively. Conclusion: It is evident from the results that the proposed preprocessing pipeline composed of the proposed ROI extraction through K-means clustering, followed by edge and contrast enhancement using Graham’s method and then z-score intensity normalization outperforms all other existing preprocessing pipelines and has proven to be the most effective preprocessing strategy in helping the baseline CNN model to extract meaningful deep features.},

Early detection of NFLDs is critical for improved prognosis of this progressive, blinding disease. We have investigated a computerized scheme for detection of NFLDs on retinal fundus images. In this study, 162 images, including 81 images with 99 NFLDs, were used. After major blood vessels were removed, the images were transformed so that the curved paths of retinal nerves become approximately straight on the basis of ellipses, and the Gabor filters were applied for enhancement of NFLDs. Bandlike regions darker than the surrounding pixels were detected as candidates of NFLDs. For each candidate, image features were determined and the likelihood of a true NFLD was determined by using the linear discriminant analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN). The sensitivity for detecting the NFLDs was 91\% at 1.0 false positive per image by using the ANN. The proposed computerized system for the detection of NFLDs can be useful to physicians in the diagnosis of glaucoma in a mass screening.},

Using this continuous definition, we present the watershed differences with classical edge detectors. We then exhibit a metric in the plane for which the watershed is a skeleton by influence zones and show the lower semicontinuous behaviour of the associated skeleton. This theoretical approach suggests an algorithm for solving the eikonal equation: ‖∇ƒ‖ = g. Finally, we end with some new watershed algorithms, which present the advantage of allowing the use of markers and/or anchor points, thus opening the way towards grey-tone skeletons.

  abstract = {We propose a new multilabel classifier, called LapTool-Net to detect the presence of surgical tools in each frame of a laparoscopic video. The novelty of LapTool-Net is the exploitation of the correlations among the usage of different tools and, the tools and tasks - i.e., the context of the tools’ usage. Towards this goal, the pattern in the co-occurrence of the tools is utilized for designing a decision policy for a multilabel classifier based on a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) architecture to simultaneously extract the spatio-temporal features. In contrast to the previous multilabel classification methods, the RCNN and the decision model are trained in an end-to-end manner using a multi-task learning scheme. To overcome the high imbalance and avoid overfitting caused by the lack of variety in the training data, a high down-sampling rate is chosen based on the more frequent combinations. Furthermore, at the post-processing step, the predictions for all the frames of a video are corrected by designing a bi-directional RNN to model the long-term tasks’ order. LapTool-Net was trained using a publicly available dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The results show LapTool-Net outperformed existing methods significantly, even while using fewer training samples and a shallower architecture.},

While interpretability and explainability are often presented as a subjectively validated binary property, we consider it a multi-faceted concept. We identify 12 conceptual properties, such as Compactness and Correctness, that should be evaluated for comprehensively assessing the quality of an explanation. Our so-called Co-12 properties serve as categorization scheme for systematically reviewing the evaluation practices of more than 300 papers published in the last 7 years at major AI and ML conferences that introduce an XAI method. We find that 1 in 3 papers evaluate exclusively with anecdotal evidence, and 1 in 5 papers evaluate with users. This survey also contributes to the call for objective, quantifiable evaluation methods by presenting an extensive overview of quantitative XAI evaluation methods. Our systematic collection of evaluation methods provides researchers and practitioners with concrete tools to thoroughly validate, benchmark and compare new and existing XAI methods. The Co-12 categorization scheme and our identified evaluation methods open up opportunities to include quantitative metrics as optimization criteria during model training in order to optimize for accuracy and interpretability simultaneously.},

Twenty years after the onset of diabetes, almost all patients with type 1 diabetes and over 60\% of patients with type 2 diabetes will have some degree of retinopathy. Prolonged diabetes retinopathy leads to maculopathy, which impairs the normal vision depending on the severity of damage of the macula. This paper presents a computer-based intelligent system for the identification of clinically significant maculopathy, non-clinically significant maculopathy and normal fundus eye images. Features are extracted from these raw fundus images which are then fed to the classifier. Our protocol uses feed-forward architecture in an artificial neural network classifier for classification of different stages. Three different kinds of eye disease conditions were tested in 350 subjects. We demonstrated a sensitivity of more than 95\% for these classifiers with a specificity of 100\%, and results are very promising. Our systems are ready to run clinically on large amounts of datasets.},

  abstract = {Changes in retinal blood vessel features are precursors of serious diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke. Therefore, analysis of retinal vascular features can assist in detecting these changes and allow the patient to take action while the disease is still in its early stages. Automation of this process would help to reduce the cost associated with trained graders and remove the issue of inconsistency introduced by manual grading. Among different retinal analysis tasks, retinal blood vessel extraction plays an extremely important role as it is the first essential step before any measurement can be made. In this paper, we present an effective method for automatically extracting blood vessels from colour retinal images. The proposed method is based on the fact that by changing the length of a basic line detector, line detectors at varying scales are achieved. To maintain the strength and eliminate the drawbacks of each individual line detector, the line responses at varying scales are linearly combined to produce the final segmentation for each retinal image. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on three publicly available DRIVE, STARE, and REVIEW datasets. On DRIVE and STARE datasets, the proposed method achieves high local accuracy (a measure to assess the accuracy at regions around the vessels) while retaining comparable accuracy compared to other existing methods. Visual inspection on the segmentation results shows that the proposed method produces accurate segmentation on central reflex vessels while keeping close vessels well separated. On REVIEW dataset, the vessel width measurements obtained using the segmentations produced by the proposed method are highly accurate and close to the measurements provided by the experts. This has demonstrated the high segmentation accuracy of the proposed method and its applicability for automatic vascular calibre measurement. Other advantages of the proposed method include its efficiency with fast segmentation time, its simplicity and scalability to deal with high resolution retinal images.},

  abstract = {A decreased ratio of the width of retinal arteries to veins [arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR)], is well established as predictive of cerebral atrophy, stroke and other cardiovascular events in adults. Tortuous and dilated arteries and veins, as well as decreased AVR are also markers for plus disease in retinopathy of prematurity. This work presents an automated method to estimate the AVR in retinal color images by detecting the location of the optic disc, determining an appropriate region of interest (ROI), classifying vessels as arteries or veins, estimating vessel widths, and calculating the AVR. After vessel segmentation and vessel width determination, the optic disc is located and the system eliminates all vessels outside the AVR measurement ROI. A skeletonization operation is applied to the remaining vessels after which vessel crossings and bifurcation points are removed, leaving a set of vessel segments consisting of only vessel centerline pixels. Features are extracted from each centerline pixel in order to assign these a soft label indicating the likelihood that the pixel is part of a vein. As all centerline pixels in a connected vessel segment should be the same type, the median soft label is assigned to each centerline pixel in the segment. Next, artery vein pairs are matched using an iterative algorithm, and the widths of the vessels are used to calculate the AVR. We trained and tested the algorithm on a set of 65 high resolution digital color fundus photographs using a reference standard that indicates for each major vessel in the image whether it is an artery or vein. We compared the AVR values produced by our system with those determined by a semi-automated reference system. We obtained a mean unsigned error of 0.06 (SD 0.04) in 40 images with a mean AVR of 0.67. A second observer using the semi-automated system obtained the same mean unsigned error of 0.06 (SD 0.05) on the set of images with a mean AVR of 0.66. The testing data and reference standard used in this study has been made publicly available.},

In this work we present the results of the first international microaneurysm detection competition, organized in the context of the Retinopathy Online Challenge (ROC), a multiyear online competition for various aspects of DR detection. For this competition, we compare the results of five different methods, produced by five different teams of researchers on the same set of data. The evaluation was performed in a uniform manner using an algorithm presented in this work. The set of data used for the competition consisted of 50 training images with available reference standard and 50 test images where the reference standard was withheld by the organizers (M. Niemeijer, B. van Ginneken, and M. D. AbrA¿moff). The results obtained on the test data was submitted through a website after which standardized evaluation software was used to determine the performance of each of the methods. A human expert detected microaneurysms in the test set to allow comparison with the performance of the automatic methods. The overall results show that microaneurysm detection is a challenging task for both the automatic methods as well as the human expert.

The evaluation was performed in a uniform manner using an algorithm presented in this work. The set of data used for the competition consisted of 50 training images with available reference standard and 50 test images where the reference standard was withheld by the organizers (M.

The results obtained on the test data was submitted through a website after which standardized evaluation software was used to determine the performance of each of the methods. A human expert detected microaneurysms in the test set to allow comparison with the performance of the automatic methods. The overall results show that microaneurysm detection is a challenging task for both the automatic methods as well as the human expert.

  abstract = {Registration of multi-modal retinal images is very significant to integrate information gained from different modalities for a reliable diagnosis of retinal diseases by ophthalmologists. However, accurate image registration is a challenging, we propose an algorithm for registration of summed-voxel projection images (SVPIs) with color fundus photographs (CFPs) based on local patch matching. SVPIs are evenly split into 16 local image blocks for extracting matching point pairs by searching local maximization of the similarity function. These matching point pairs are used for a coarse registration and then a search region of feature matching points is redefined for a more accurate registration. The performance of our registration algorithm is tested on a series of datasets including 3 normal eyes and 20 eyes with age-related macular degeneration. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve accurate registration results (the average of root mean square error is 128μm).},

  abstract = {Paper Info Reviews Meta-review Author Feedback Post-Rebuttal Meta-reviews Authors Zhe Xu, Donghuan Lu, Yixin Wang, Jie Luo, Jagadeesan Jayender, Kai Ma, Yefeng Zheng, Xiu Li Abstract Manually segmenting the hepatic vessels from Computer Tomography (CT) is far more expertise-demanding and laborious than other structures due to the low-contrast and complex morphology of vessels, resulting in the extreme lack of high-quality labeled data. Without sufficient high-quality annotations, the usual data-driven learning-based approaches struggle with deficient training. On the other hand, directly introducing additional data with low-quality annotations may confuse the network, leading to undesirable performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel mean-teacher-assisted confident learning framework to robustly exploit the noisy labeled data for the challenging hepatic vessel segmentation task. Specifically, with the adapted confident learning assisted by a third party, i.e., the weight-averaged teacher model, the noisy labels in the additional low-quality dataset can be transformed from \textbackslash textit\{‘encumbrance’\} to \textbackslash textit\{‘treasure’\} via progressive pixel-wise soft-correction, thus providing productive guidance. Extensive experiments using two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component.

The method makes use of a student-teacher paradigm and presents empirical results on hepatic vessel segmentation.

Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. First, problem that this work is trying to address is very important and pervasive in our field. Label noise is common and often unavoidable, and with such a scarcity of segmentation label, we are often forced to utilize labels from multiple sources with varying levels of quality. Second, the paper is well-written and makes effective use of tables and figures to demonstrate the issue and support its arguments. Finally, the authors used publicly-available data and they say they will release their code which will help facilitate the replication and extension of this work. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The authors applied their method to only the single problem of hepatic vessel segmentation, and all empirical results are derived from a test set with only ten segmented cases. Because of this, even though the results look promising, it’s difficult to be sure that this is not just a lucky coincidence. No attempt is made to demonstrate the statistical significance of the reported improvement.

By encouraging consistent segmentation under different perturbations of the same image, the network can exploit image information with low-quality annotations. The teacher model serves as “third party” to provide guidance in identifying label noises and perform progressive pixel-wise soft-correction. Experiments using two public datasets (3DIRCADb, Medical Image Decathlon) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed contributions and show that the annotation quality of noisy labeled data can be improved with a small amount of high-quality labeled data only.

Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html The submitted paper is innovative and well written. Comments provided below could be taken into account for further improvements. Main comments : Method. The student model is optimized by minimizing the supervised loss on high-quality annotated data as well as an unsupervised consistency loss between predictions from student and teacher models on both datasets. The progressive self-denoising process which is added to the whole framework remains less clear. You should explicitly explain that \$\textbackslash hat\{p\}\_j\$ is obtained using the teacher model. I also suggest you to provide more interpretations to let readers precisely understand: 1- the estimation of \$t\_j\$, 2- how the joint distribution matrix formulation (Eq.2) is derived from the confusion matrix (Eq.1) as well as 3- the smoothly self-denoising operation (Eq.3). Finally, I wonder why \$\textbackslash mathcal\{L\}\_s\$ involves cross-entropy, Dice, focal and boundary losses while \$\textbackslash mathcal\{L\}\_cl\$ uses cross-entropy and focal losses only. Experiments. The high-quality annotated dataset is randomly divided into two groups (10 cases for training, 10 for test). The article does not mention any cross-validation strategy. Do you use cross-validation to strengthen the effectiveness of the obtained results? Even if the 3DIRCADb dataset is relatively small, you should include a validation subset to find the optimal network hyper-parameters. Ablation study. What does “MTCL(c) w/o SSDM” means exactly? Does it correspond to hard-correction (instead of the proposed soft-correction, Eq.3) ? Comparisons. I would suggest you to use other state-of-the-art methods additionally to Huang et al. [8] and standard U-Net to improve the experimental part. Minor comments: Introduction. Instead of “noises”, I would refer to “wrong annotations” when dealing with unlabeled or mislabeled pixels. Related works. You should explain more precisely why Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) fails to exploit the potential useful information of noisy label. Methods. An Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is employed. What is the influence of the EMA decay rate \$\textbackslash alpha\$? In the same spirit, you could explain how \$n\$ and \$\textbackslash tau\$ parameters are selected and what is their related sensibility. Results. I would have integrated the quantitative results of sub-section “Effectiveness of label self-denoising” into Tab.1. Statistical analysis: performance gains could be confirmed using t-tests.

(+) Innovative contributions (+) Well-conducted ablation study (-) More insights required to explain the progressive self-denoising process What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 2 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Confident but not absolutely certain Review \#3 Please describe the contribution of the paper This paper introduces a method to train a segmentation network on a dataset containing incorrect or incomplete labels, which may happen even on public datasets. The method is based on a mean-teacher training procedure, where both a trainer and a student networks are trained simultaneously. The high quality images are used as usual, while the low quality ones are used (1) in an unsupervised way via a consistency loss over random perturbations, (2) within a novel confidence estimation and relabeling procedure. The method is evaluated in the context of liver vessel segmentation using two public datasets: one with high quality segmentation and the other with incomplete segmentations. Please list the main strengths of the paper; you should write about a novel formulation, an original way to use data, demonstration of clinical feasibility, a novel application, a particularly strong evaluation, or anything else that is a strong aspect of this work. Please provide details, for instance, if a method is novel, explain what aspect is novel and why this is interesting. Datasets with bad segmentation quality are still quite common, so this method addresses an important problem which can be helpful to the community. The experimental setup is sound and seems pretty convincing, ablation studies have been performed. The authors plan to release their source code. Please list the main weaknesses of the paper. Please provide details, for instance, if you think a method is not novel, explain why and provide a reference to prior work. The method is quite complex with many parameters: three loss functions (one of them also having three sub-components), \textbackslash lambda\_\{cl\} mus be set to zero for the first thousands iterations, etc. I expect it to be a bit hard to re-implement. The description of the method could be improved (see comments below). The validation dataset of 10 images is quite limited. Some other baselines could have been tested (see comments below). Please rate the clarity and organization of this paper Satisfactory Please comment on the reproducibility of the paper. Note, that authors have filled out a reproducibility checklist upon submission. Please be aware that authors are not required to meet all criteria on the checklist - for~instance, providing code and data is a plus, but not a requirement for acceptance I disagree with the claim that “The average runtime for each result, or estimated energy cost.” is not applicable in this case. Training two networks instead of one definitely comes with a cost in computational time and memory footprint compared to a standard UNet. This should have been discussed. The code has not been attached as supplementary material. Please provide detailed and constructive comments for the authors. Please also refer to our Reviewer’s guide on what makes a good review: https://miccai2021.org/en/REVIEWER-GUIDELINES.html It seems that most of the wrong pixel labels are false negative: vessels that should have been labelled but are not (due to the tedious nature of the task). There are losses (for instance Tversky loss) to accomodate for that kind of bias, but they are unfortunately not considered in the paper. Furthermore there are some other more simple baselines: train a network, then apply it on the training images, then retrain on those newly labeled images. Reporting average numbers are not enough - we need more information on the error distribution (min/max/std). Actually in this case, since there are only 10 validation cases, it would have been possible to report the numbers for each case individually. It is a bit startling to still see papers without any statistical test. I am not sure if the experiment comparing training on the HQ+LQ data vs training only on HQ data is fair. Since there are much more LQ data, it seems that training on HQ+LQ means training on LQ only. The HQ should be sampled much more often so that an HQ image appears as often as a LQ one. The decision to not resample in the z-direction is very surprising. If the slice thickness changes, the network has to unnecessarily learn structures with a different size in this direction. I do not understand the invoked rationale of “avoiding resampling artifacts”. Furthermore this is even acknowledged by the authors when they report that 3D networks are worse than 2D ones. There is a little bit of name dropping overall in the paper (but more particularly in Section 1), which may seem a bit intimidating for some readers (“Mean-Teacher-assisted Confident Learning”, “Classification Noise Process”, “Smoothly Self-Denoising Module”). Adding a primer on teacher-student networks would have made the paper self-contained. I have the feeling that the subsection “Learn from Progressively Self-Denoised Soft Labels of Set-LQ” could have been explained more simply. In that case, I don’t think the mathematical notations help a lot. For instance, you could consider moving all the equations to a supplementary material and spend more time giving a higher level, more intuitive, description of the approach. Or maybe some pseudo-code would have been clearer. The word “treasure” in the title and the paper is a bit clickbaity (when consdidering the overall improvement) and could be toned down. Figure 3 is not very readable, and in particular not colorblind friendly (consider using blue instead of green for instance) Please state your overall opinion of the paper Probably accept (7) Please justify your recommendation. What were the major factors that led you to your overall score for this paper? Although I do think this paper could be improved, it addresses a relevant problem and the presented method seems to provide a significant boost in terms of segmentation. I have some concerns about reproducibility (and in particular re-implementation) but the authors plan to release their code, therefore I recommend to accept it. What is the ranking of this paper in your review stack? 1 Number of papers in your stack 5 Reviewer confidence Confident but not absolutely certain Primary Meta-Review Please provide your assessment of this work, taking into account all reviews.

Overall: very strong, we justified paper that could be improved with a typical baseline. What is the ranking of this paper in your stack? Use a number between 1 (best paper in your stack) and n (worst paper in your stack of n papers). 3 Author Feedback We are glad that reviewers found our problem and motivation “not widely investigated but very important and promising in MIA field”. They also found our work “innovative”, “well-written”, “makes effective use of tables and figures to demonstrate the issue and support its arguments”, “nice set of contributions” and “methodological contributions are assessed rigorously”. We also appreciate all the constructive comments from reviewers such as some valuable suggestions about the design of other baselines. Besides, thanks AC for appreciating the second application target (i.e., using tiny HQ labeled data to improve label quality of LQ labeled data) would also be an interesting direction. Consistently, we are working on our extended journal version. Nevertheless, this work is still an early attempt and can be further improved. We feel grateful that this work is early accepted and look forward to more research on this field. back to top},

  abstract = {Learning exists in the context of data, yet notions of confidence typically focus on model predictions, not label quality. Confident learning (CL) is an alternative approach which focuses instead on label quality by characterizing and identifying label errors in datasets, based on the principles of pruning noisy data, counting with probabilistic thresholds to estimate noise, and ranking examples to train with confidence. Whereas numerous studies have developed these principles independently, here, we combine them, building on the assumption of a class-conditional noise process to directly estimate the joint distribution between noisy (given) labels and uncorrupted (unknown) labels. This results in a generalized CL which is provably consistent and experimentally performant. We present sufficient conditions where CL exactly finds label errors, and show CL performance exceeding seven recent competitive approaches for learning with noisy labels on the CIFAR dataset. Uniquely, the CL framework is not coupled to a specific data modality or model (e.g., we use CL to find several label errors in the presumed error-free MNIST dataset and improve sentiment classification on text data in Amazon Reviews). We also employ CL on ImageNet to quantify ontological class overlap (e.g., estimating 645 missile images are mislabeled as their parent class projectile), and moderately increase model accuracy (e.g., for ResNet) by cleaning data prior to training. These results are replicable using the open-source cleanlab release.},

  abstract = {Accurate quantification of retinal structures in 3-D optical coherence tomography data of eyes with pathologies provides clinically relevant information. We present an approach to jointly segment retinal layers and lesions in eyes with topology-disrupting retinal diseases by a loosely coupled level set framework. In the new approach, lesions are modeled as an additional space-variant layer delineated by auxiliary interfaces. Furthermore, the segmentation of interfaces is steered by local differences in the signal between adjacent retinal layers, thereby allowing the approach to handle local intensity variations. The accuracy of the proposed method of both layer and lesion segmentation has been evaluated on eyes affected by central serous retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. In addition, layer segmentation of the proposed approach was evaluated on eyes without topology-disrupting retinal diseases. Good agreement between the segmentation performed manually by a medical doctor and results obtained from the automatic segmentation was found for all data types. The mean unsigned error for all interfaces varied between 2.3 and 11.9 μm (0.6-3.1 pixels). Furthermore, lesion segmentation showed a Dice coefficient of 0.68 for drusen and 0.89 for fluid pockets. Overall, the method provides a flexible and accurate solution to jointly segment lesions and retinal layers.},

  abstract = {The present paper describes a new and efficient method for registration of retinal angiogram. The presence of noise, the variations in the background, and the temporal variation of fluorescence level poses serious problems in obtaining a robust registration of the retinal image. Here, a multiscale registration scheme is proposed which comprises of three steps. The first step of this work proposes an edge preserving smoothing of the vascular tree. This morphological filtering approach is based on opening and closing with a linear rotating structuring element. For complete preservation of the linear shape of the vascular structures, a morphological reconstruction by dilation of the opened image and a reconstruction by erosion of the closed image are applied. It is proposed to compute the registration transform between two successive original frames, from their morphological gradient. Then, the second step consists in computing the morphological gradient of the two filtered images and radiometrically correcting these gradient images. To take into account the intensity variations, our model incorporates two constant multiplicative and additive factors (based on contrast and brightness) estimated employing a simple analysis of the local histograms (based on a sliding window). In the third step, the proposed method computes the registering transform through a coarse-to-fine (or multiscale) hierarchical approach. After computing the dominant registering transform (which implies the translation) between two successive frames, an elastic transform (also called local affine transform) is carried out to achieve a residual correction. The proposed method is tested by experimental studies, performed on macular fluorescein and Indo cyanine green angiographies. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that our proposed registering method is robust, accurate and fully automated, and it is not based on the extraction of the features or landmarks.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical imaging that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN architectures such as the U-Net model with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation.

  abstract = {Tropical cyclones are becoming an increasing menace to society as populations grow in coastal regions. Forecasting the intensity of these often-temperamental weather systems can be a real challenge, especially if the true intensity at the forecast time is not well known. To address this issue, techniques to accurately estimate tropical cyclone intensity from satellites are a natural goal because in situ observations over the vast oceanic basins are scarce. The most widely utilized satellite-based method to estimate tropical cyclone intensity is the Dvorak technique, a partially subjective scheme that has been employed operationally at tropical forecast centers around the world for over 30 yr. With the recent advent of improved satellite sensors, the rapid advances in computing capacity, and accumulated experience with the behavioral characteristics of the Dvorak technique, the development of a fully automated, computer-based objective scheme to derive tropical cyclone intensity has become possible. In this paper the advanced Dvorak technique is introduced, which, as its name implies, is a derivative of the original Dvorak technique. The advanced Dvorak technique builds on the basic conceptual model and empirically derived rules of the original Dvorak technique, but advances the science and applicability in an automated environment that does not require human intervention. The algorithm is the culmination of a body of research that includes the objective Dvorak technique (ODT) and advanced objective Dvorak technique (AODT) developed at the University of Wisconsin—Madison’s Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies. The ODT could only be applied to storms that possessed a minimum intensity of hurricane/typhoon strength. In addition, the ODT still required a storm center location to be manually selected by an analyst prior to algorithm execution. These issues were the primary motivations for the continued advancement of the algorithm (AODT). While these two objective schemes had as their primary goal to simply achieve the basic functionality and performance of the Dvorak technique in a computer-driven environment, the advanced Dvorak technique exceeds the boundaries of the original Dvorak technique through modifications based on rigorous statistical and empirical analysis. It is shown that the accuracy of the advanced Dvorak technique is statistically competitive with the original Dvorak technique, and can provide objective tropical cyclone intensity guidance for systems in all global basins.},

Regular screening and timely intervention can halt or reverse the progression of this disease. This paper describes an approach that is based on the generalized eigenvectors of affinity matrix to extract microaneurysms from digital retinal images. Microaneurysms are in the low intensity regions and detection is complicated by their small sizes, the presence of retinal vessels, and their similarity to another type of retinal abnormality - haemorrhages. In order to accurately detect microaneurysms, the affinity matrix is defined to suppress larger structures such as blood vessels, haemorrhages, etc and to create uniform affinity distribution for pixels belonging to microaneurysms. The generalized eigenvector solution seeks to find the optimal segmentation for microaneurysms and provides indication to the possible locations of microaneurysms. We differentiate the true microaneurysms by studying their feature characteristics. Experiments on 70 retinal sub-images of diabetic patients indicate that we are able to achieve 93\% accuracy in the detection of microaneurysms.},

However, domain changes may occur continuously and unpredictably during deployment (e.g. sudden weather changes).

In this paper, we tackle Online Domain Adaptation (OnDA) for semantic segmentation. We design a pipeline that is robust to continuous domain shifts, either gradual or sudden, and we evaluate it in the case of rainy and foggy scenarios. Our experiments show that our framework can effectively adapt to new domains during deployment, while not being affected by catastrophic forgetting of the previous domains.},

Early detection, diagnosis, and correct treatment could save the eye’s vision. Nevertheless, an eye may be afflicted with several diseases if proper care is not taken. A single retinal fundus image might be linked to one or more diseases. Age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, Glaucoma, and uncorrected refractive errors are the leading causes of visual impairment. Our research team at the center of excellence lab has generated a new dataset called the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset 2.0 (RFMiD2.0). This dataset includes around 860 retinal fundus images, annotated by three eye specialists, and is a multiclass, multilabel dataset. We gathered images from a research facility in Jalna and Nanded, where patients across Maharashtra come for preventative and therapeutic eye care. Our dataset would be the second publicly available dataset consisting of the most frequent diseases, along with some rarely identified diseases. This dataset is auxiliary to the previously published RFMiD dataset. This dataset would be significant for the research and development of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology.},

Literature Review: Fundus cameras play a vital role in addressing the cause of preventive blindness. More attention is being turned to developing countries, where infrastructure and access to healthcare are limited. One of the major limitations for tele-ophthalmology is restricted access to the office-based fundus camera. Results: Recent advances in access to telecommunications coupled with introduction of portable cameras and smartphone-based fundus imaging systems have resulted in an exponential surge in available technologies for portable fundus photography. Retinal cameras in the near future would have to cater to these needs by featuring a low-cost, portable design with automated controls and digitalized images with Web-based transfer. Conclusions: In this review, we aim to highlight the advances of fundus photography for retinal screening as well as discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and implications of the various technologies that are currently available.},

It works well for RNNs and improves both the training time and the generalization performance of several existing RNN models. More recently, it has been used with Transformer models. We compute the layer normalization statistics over all the hidden units in the same layer as follows: \$\$ \textbackslash mu\^\{l\} = \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{H\}\textbackslash sum\^\{H\}\_\{i=1\}a\_\{i\}\^\{l\} \$\$ \$\$ \textbackslash sigma\^\{l\} = \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{H\}\textbackslash sum\^\{H\}\_\{i=1\}\textbackslash left(a\_\{i\}\^\{l\}-\textbackslash mu\^\{l\}\textbackslash right)\^\{2\}\}  \$\$ where \$H\$ denotes the number of hidden units in a layer. Under layer normalization, all the hidden units in a layer share the same normalization terms \$\textbackslash mu\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\$, but different training cases have different normalization terms. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization does not impose any constraint on the size of the mini-batch and it can be used in the pure online regime with batch size 1.},

Only the presence of focal LC defects was significantly different between the progressing and stable patients (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Baseline intraocular pressure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.076; P\,=\,0.098) and the presence of focal LC defects at the DH site (HR, 2.620; P\,=\,0.002) were found to be associated with VF progression. Glaucoma eyes with DH at the site of focal LC defects showed frequent and faster VF progression compared with DH not accompanied by LC alterations or LC alterations not accompanied by DH. Evaluating LC alterations in glaucoma eyes with DH may be important in predicting the progression of glaucoma.},

Recent work has shown that self-attention is an effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize a recently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood. By restricting the selfattention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. While conceptually simple, our generative models significantly outperform the current state of the art in image generation on ImageNet, improving the best published negative log-likelihood on ImageNet from 3.83 to 3.77. We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a human evaluation study, we find that images generated by our super-resolution model fool human observers three times more often than the previous state of the art.},

Even though state-of-the-art deep learning models have achieved human-level accuracy on the classification of different types of medical data, these models are hardly adopted in clinical workflows, mainly due to their lack of interpretability. The black-box-ness of deep learning models has raised the need for devising strategies to explain the decision process of these models, leading to the creation of the topic of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this context, we provide a thorough survey of XAI applied to medical imaging diagnosis, including visual, textual, example-based and concept-based explanation methods. Moreover, this work reviews the existing medical imaging datasets and the existing metrics for evaluating the quality of the explanations. In addition, we include a performance comparison among a set of report generation-based methods. Finally, the major challenges in applying XAI to medical imaging and the future research directions on the topic are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes with a prevalence of \textasciitilde 35\%, and is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in people of working age in most developed countries. The earliest stage of DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), may progress to sight-threatening DR (STDR). Thus, early detection of DR and active regular screening of patients with diabetes are necessary for earlier intervention to prevent sight loss. While some countries offer systematic DR screening, most nations are reliant on opportunistic screening or do not offer any screening owing to limited healthcare resources and infrastructure. Currently, retinal imaging approaches for DR screening include those with and without mydriasis, imaging in single or multiple fields, and the use of conventional or ultra-wide-field imaging. Advances in telescreening and automated detection facilitate screening in previously hard-to-reach communities. Despite the heterogeneity in approaches to fit local needs, an evidence base must be created for each model to inform practice. In this review, we appraise different aspects of DR screening, including technological advances, identify evidence gaps, and propose several studies to improve DR screening globally, with a view to identifying patients with moderate-to-severe NPDR who would benefit if a convenient treatment option to delay progression to STDR became available.},

  abstract = {This review presents empirical researchers with recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

Image quality need however to be sufficient in order to enable grading of the severity of the condition. In this paper, we propose a new method to evaluate the quality of retinal images by computing a score for each image. Images are classified as gradable or ungradable based on this score. First, we use two different U-Net models to segment the macula and the vessels in the original image. We then extract a patch around the macula in the image containing the vessels. Finally, we compute a quality score based on the presence of small vessels in this patch. The score is interpretable as the method is heavily inspired by the way clinicians assess image quality, according to the Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Grading Scheme. The performances are evaluated on a validation database labeled by a clinician. This method presented a sensitivity of 95\% and a specificity of 100\% on this database.},

  abstract = {Many clinicians remain wary of machine learning because of longstanding concerns about “black box” models. “Black box” is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans. Lack of interpretability in predictive models can undermine trust in those models, especially in health care, in which so many decisions are— literally—life and death issues. There has been a recent explosion of research in the field of explainable machine learning aimed at addressing these concerns. The promise of explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical decision-support tools or novel research papers to have critical understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of explainable machine learning as they apply to cardiology. Key concepts reviewed include interpretability vs explainability and global vs local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence plots. We discuss several limitations with explainability techniques, focusing on the how the nature of explanations as approximations may omit important information about how black-box models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use black- box models with explanations rather than interpretable models. Résumé De nombreux cliniciens restent méfiants envers l’apprentissage automatique en raison de préoccupations de longue date concernant les modèles à « boîte noire ». Le terme « boîte noire » sert à désigner des modèles suffisamment complexes pour échapper à une interprétation simple par un humain. Le manque d’interprétabilité des modèles prédictifs peut miner la confiance en ces modèles, en particulier dans le domaine des soins de santé, où tant de décisions sont littéralement des questions de vie ou de mort. Il y a eu récemment une explosion de la recherche consacrée à l’apprentissage automatique explicable visant à répondre à ces préoccupations. L’apprentissage automatique explicable est très prometteur, mais il importe que les cardiologues aient une compréhension critique de ses forces et de ses limites puisqu’ils pourraient le retrouver dans des outils d’aide à la décision clinique ou des rapports de recherche de pointe. Cet article passe en revue les concepts et éléments techniques clés de l’apprentissage automatique explicable, tels qu’ils s’appliquent à la cardiologie. Les concepts clés que nous examinons comprennent l’interprétabilité par rapport à l’explicabilité et les explications globales par rapport aux explications locales. Au nombre des éléments techniques présentés figurent la mesure d’importance des variables à partir de permutations, les arbres de décision de substitution, l’algorithme LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) et les tracés de dépendance partielle. Nous abordons plusieurs limites des éléments techniques d’explicabilité, en attirant l’attention sur le fait que la nature approximative des explications peut mener à l’omission d’informations importantes sur la façon dont les modèles à boîte noire fonctionnent et les fondements de certaines prévisions obtenues à l’aide de ces modèles. Pour conclure, nous proposons une méthode empirique permettant de déterminer quand il est approprié d’utiliser des modèles à boîte noire assortis d’explications plutôt que des modèles interprétables.},

The tremendous popularity of this model and its variants comes from its high performance and its ability to produce interpretable predictions. However, both of these characteristics remain to be assessed in depth on retinal images. This study proposes a thorough performance evaluation of several Transformers compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for retinal disease classification. Special attention is given to multi-modality imaging (fundus and OCT) and generalization to external data. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to generate interpretable predictions via attribution maps. Existing attribution methods from Transformer models have the disadvantage of producing low-resolution heatmaps. Our contribution, called Focused Attention, uses iterative conditional patch resampling to tackle this issue. By means of a survey involving four retinal specialists, we validated both the superior interpretability of Vision Transformers compared to the attribution maps produced from CNNs and the relevance of Focused Attention as a lesion detector.},

  abstract = {Le travail de recherche mené dans le cadre de cette maîtrise porte sur l’exploitation de l’imagerie de la rétine à des fins de diagnostic automatique. Il se concentre sur l’image de fond d’oeil, qui donne accès à une représentation en deux dimensions et en couleur de la surface de la rétine. Ces images peuvent présenter des symptômes de maladie, sous forme de lésions ou de déformations des structures anatomiques de la rétine. L’objet de cette maîtrise est de proposer une méthodologie de segmentation simultanée de ces lésions dans l’image de fond d’oeil, regroupées en deux catégories : claires ou sombres. Réaliser cette double segmentation de façon simultanée est inédit : la vaste majorité des travaux précédents se concentrant sur un seul type de lésions. Or, du fait des contraintes de temps et de la difficulté que cela représente dans un environnement clinique, il est impossible pour un clinicien de tester la multitude d’algorithmes existants. D’autant plus que lorsqu’un patient se présente pour un examen, le clinicien n’a aucune connaissance a priori sur le type de pathologie et par conséquent sur le type d’algorithme à utiliser. Pour envisager une utilisation clinique, il est donc important de réfléchir à une solution polyvalente, rapide et aisément déployable. Parallèlement, l’apprentissage profond a démontré sa capacité à s’adapter à de nombreux problèmes de visions par ordinateur et à généraliser ses performances sur des données variées malgré des ensembles d’entraînement parfois restreints. Pour cela, de nouvelles stratégies sont régulièrement proposées, ambitionnant d’extraire toujours mieux les informations issues de la base d’entraînement. En conséquence, nous nous sommes fixés pour objectif de développer une architecture de réseaux de neurones capable de rechercher toutes les lésions dans une image de fond d’oeil. Pour répondre à cet objectif, notre méthodologie s’appuie sur une nouvelle architecture de réseaux de neurones convolutifs reposant sur une structure multitâche entraînée selon une approche hybride faisant appel à de l’apprentissage supervisé et faiblement supervisé. L’architecture se compose d’un encodeur partagé par deux décodeurs spécialisés chacun dans un type de lésions. Ainsi, les mêmes caractéristiques sont extraites par l’encodeur pour les deux décodeurs. Dans un premier temps, le réseau est entraîné avec des régions d’images et la vérité terrain correspondante indiquant les lésions (apprentissage supervisé). Dans un second temps, seul l’encodeur est ré-entraîné avec des images complètes avec une vérité terrain composé d’un simple scalaire indiquant si l’image présente des pathologies ou non, sans préciser leur position et leur type (apprentissage faiblement supervisé).----------ABSTRACT: This work focuses on automatic diagnosis on fundus images, which are a bidimensional representation of the inner structure of the eye. The aim of this master’s thesis is to discuss a solution for an automatic segmentation of the lesions that can be observed in the retina. The proposed methodology regroups those lesions in two categories: red and bright. Obtaining a simultaneous double segmentation is a novel approach; most of the previous works focus on the detection of a single type of lesions. However, due to time constraints and the tedeous nature of this work, clinicians usually can not test all the existing methods. Moreover, from a screening perspective, the clinician has no clue a priori on the nature of the pathology he deals with and thus on which algorithm to start with. Therefore, the proposed algorithm requires to be versatile, fast and easily deployable. Conforted by the recent progresses obtained with machine learning methods (and especially deep learning), we decide to develop a novel convolutional neural network able to segment both types of lesions on fundus images. To reach this goal, our methodology relies on a new multitask architecture, trained on a hybrid method combining weak and normal supervised training. The architecture relies on hard parameter sharing: two decoders (one per type of lesion) share a single encoder. Therefore, the encoder is trained on deriving an abstrast representation of the input image. Those extracted features permit a discrimination between both bright and red lesions. In other words, the encoder is trained on detecting pathological tissues from normal ones. The training is done in two steps. During the first one, the whole architecture is trained with patches, with a groundtruth at a pixel level, which is the typical way of training a segmentation network. The second step consists in weak supervision. Only the encoder is trained with full images and its task is to predict the status of the given image (pathological or healthy), without specifying anything concerning the potential lesions in it (neither location nor type). In this case, the groundtruth is a simple boolean number. This second step allows the network to see a larger number of images: indeed, this type of groundtruth is considerably easier to acquire and already available in large public databases. This step relies on the hypothesis that it is possible to use an annotation at an image level (globally) to enhance the performance at a pixel level (locally). This is an intuitive idea, as the pathological status is directly correlated with the presence of lesions.},

Methods are classified according to the different aspects of mutual-information-based registration. The main division is in aspects of the methodology and of the application. The part on methodology describes choices made on facets such as preprocessing of images, gray value interpolation, optimization, adaptations to the mutual information measure, and different types of geometrical transformations. The part on applications is a reference of the literature available on different modalities, on interpatient registration and on different anatomical objects. Comparison studies including mutual information are also considered. The paper starts with a description of entropy and mutual information and it closes with a discussion on past achievements and some future challenges.},

  abstract = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of avoidable vision loss, predominantly affecting the working-age population across the globe. Screening for DR, coupled with timely consultation and treatment, is a globally trusted policy to avoid vision loss. However, implementation of DR screening programs is challenging due to the scarcity of medical professionals able to screen a growing global diabetic population at risk for DR. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in retinal image analysis could provide a sustainable approach for such large-scale screening effort. The recent scientific advances in computing capacity and machine learning approaches provide an avenue for biomedical scientists to reach this goal. Aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic DR diagnosis, a grand challenge on “Diabetic Retinopathy – Segmentation and Grading” was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI - 2018). In this paper, we report the set-up and results of this challenge that is primarily based on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD). There were three principal sub-challenges: lesion segmentation, disease severity grading, and localization of retinal landmarks and segmentation. These multiple tasks in this challenge allow to test the generalizability of algorithms, and this is what makes it different from existing ones. It received a positive response from the scientific community with 148 submissions from 495 registrations effectively entered in this challenge. This paper outlines the challenge, its organization, the dataset used, evaluation methods and results of top-performing participating solutions. The top-performing approaches utilized a blend of clinical information, data augmentation, and an ensemble of models. These findings have the potential to enable new developments in retinal image analysis and image-based DR screening in particular.},

We develop a network with CNN architecture and data augmentation which can identify the intricate features involved in the classification task such as micro-aneurysms, exudate and haemorrhages on the retina and consequently provide a diagnosis automatically and without user input. We train this network using a high-end graphics processor unit (GPU) on the publicly available Kaggle dataset and demonstrate impressive results, particularly for a high-level classification task. On the data set of 80,000 images used our proposed CNN achieves a sensitivity of 95\% and an accuracy of 75\% on 5,000 validation images.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, large datasets of fundus photographs have been collected in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these datasets were used to train automatic detectors for DR and a few other frequent pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits the adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions that ophthalmologists currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The reason is that standard deep learning requires too many examples of these conditions. However, this limitation can be addressed with few-shot learning, a machine learning paradigm where a classifier has to generalize to a new category not seen in training, given only a few examples of this category. This paper presents a new few-shot learning framework that extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for frequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare condition detection. It is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive photographs containing the same anomalies as similar, even though these CNNs were trained to detect unrelated conditions. This observation was based on the t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our probabilistic model. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 screening examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network show that 37 conditions, out of 41, can be detected with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938). In particular, this framework significantly outperforms other frameworks for detecting rare conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and Siamese networks, another few-shot learning solution. We expect these richer predictions to trigger the adoption of automated eye pathology screening, which will revolutionize clinical practice in ophthalmology.},

Given a large medical archive, where each image is associated with a diagnosis, efficient pathology detectors or classifiers can be trained with virtually no expert knowledge about the target pathologies. However, deep learning algorithms, including the popular ConvNets, are black boxes: little is known about the local patterns analyzed by ConvNets to make a decision at the image level. A solution is proposed in this paper to create heatmaps showing which pixels in images play a role in the image-level predictions. In other words, a ConvNet trained for image-level classification can be used to detect lesions as well.

The proposed solution is applied to diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in a dataset of almost 90,000 fundus photographs from the 2015 Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy competition and a private dataset of almost 110,000 photographs (e-ophtha). For the task of detecting referable DR, very good detection performance was achieved: Az=0.954 in Kaggle’s dataset and Az=0.949 in e-ophtha. Performance was also evaluated at the image level and at the lesion level in the DiaretDB1 dataset, where four types of lesions are manually segmented: microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates and cotton-wool spots. For the task of detecting images containing these four lesion types, the proposed detector, which was trained to detect referable DR, outperforms recent algorithms trained to detect those lesions specifically, with pixel-level supervision. At the lesion level, the proposed detector outperforms heatmap generation algorithms for ConvNets. This detector is part of the Messidor® system for mobile eye pathology screening. Because it does not rely on expert knowledge or manual segmentation for detecting relevant patterns, the proposed solution is a promising image mining tool, which has the potential to discover new biomarkers in images.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven its relevance for medical decision support. However, the “black-box” nature of successful AI algorithms still holds back their wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we describe an eXplanatory Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that reaches the same level of performance as black-box AI, for the task of classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity using Color Fundus Photography (CFP). This algorithm, called ExplAIn, learns to segment and categorize lesions in images; the final image-level classification directly derives from these multivariate lesion segmentations. The novelty of this explanatory framework is that it is trained from end to end, with image supervision only, just like black-box AI algorithms: the concepts of lesions and lesion categories emerge by themselves. For improved lesion localization, foreground/background separation is trained through self-supervision, in such a way that occluding foreground pixels transforms the input image into a healthy-looking image. The advantage of such an architecture is that automatic diagnoses can be explained simply by an image and/or a few sentences. ExplAIn is evaluated at the image level and at the pixel level on various CFP image datasets. We expect this new framework, which jointly offers high classification performance and explainability, to facilitate AI deployment.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy is a serious microvascular disorder that might result in loss of vision and blindness. It seriously damages the retinal blood vessels and reduces the light-sensitive inner layer of the eye. Due to the manual inspection of retinal fundus images on diabetic retinopathy to detect the morphological abnormalities in Microaneurysms (MAs), Exudates (EXs), Haemorrhages (HMs), and Inter retinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) is very difficult and time consuming process. In order to avoid this, the regular follow-up screening process, and early automatic Diabetic Retinopathy detection are necessary. This paper discusses various methods of analysing automatic retinopathy detection and classification of different grading based on the severity levels. In addition, retinal blood vessel detection techniques are also discussed for the ultimate detection and diagnostic procedure of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, the paper elaborately discussed the systematic review accessed by authors on various publicly available databases collected from different medical sources. In the survey, meta-analysis of several methods for diabetic feature extraction, segmentation and various types of classifiers have been used to evaluate the system performance metrics for the diagnosis of DR. This survey will be helpful for the technical persons and researchers who want to focus on enhancing the diagnosis of a system that would be more powerful in real life.},

Together these components provide a context in which explanation methods can be evaluated regarding their adequacy. The goal of this chapter is to bridge the gap between expert users and lay users. Different kinds of users are identified and their concerns revealed, relevant statements from the General Data Protection Regulation are analyzed in the context of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a taxonomy for the classification of existing explanation methods is introduced, and finally, the various classes of explanation methods are analyzed to verify if user concerns are justified. Overall, it is clear that (visual) explanations can be given about various aspects of the influence of the input on the output. However, it is noted that explanation methods or interfaces for lay users are missing and we speculate which criteria these methods/interfaces should satisfy. Finally it is noted that two important concerns are difficult to address with explanation methods: the concern about bias in datasets that leads to biased DNNs, as well as the suspicion about unfair outcomes.},

  abstract = {With the advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) empowered applications for critical applications like healthcare, the questions about liability, trust, and interpretability of their outputs are raising. The black-box nature of various DL models is a roadblock to clinical utilization. Therefore, to gain the trust of clinicians and patients, we need to provide explanations about the decisions of models. With the promise of enhancing the trust and transparency of black-box models, researchers are in the phase of maturing the field of eXplainable ML (XML). In this paper, we provided a comprehensive review of explainable and interpretable ML techniques for various healthcare applications. Along with highlighting security, safety, and robustness challenges that hinder the trustworthiness of ML, we also discussed the ethical issues arising because of the use of ML/DL for healthcare. We also describe how explainable and trustworthy ML can resolve all these ethical problems. Finally, we elaborate on the limitations of existing approaches and highlight various open research problems that require further development.},

  abstract = {To investigate the effect of preprocessing techniques including contrast enhancement and illumination correction on retinal image quality, a comparative study was carried out. We studied and implemented a few illumination correction and contrast enhancement techniques on color retinal images to find out the best technique for optimum image enhancement. To compare and choose the best illumination correction technique we analyzed the corrected red and green components of color retinal images statistically and visually. The two contrast enhancement techniques were analyzed using a vessel segmentation algorithm by calculating the sensitivity and specificity. The statistical evaluation of the illumination correction techniques were carried out by calculating the coefficients of variation. The dividing method using the median filter to estimate background illumination showed the lowest Coefficients of variations in the red component. The quotient and homomorphic filtering methods after the dividing method presented good results based on their low Coefficients of variations. The contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization increased the sensitivity of the vessel segmentation algorithm up to 5\% in the same amount of accuracy. The contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization technique has a higher sensitivity than the polynomial transformation operator as a contrast enhancement technique for vessel segmentation. Three techniques including the dividing method using the median filter to estimate background, quotient based and homomorphic filtering were found as the effective illumination correction techniques based on a statistical evaluation. Applying the local contrast enhancement technique, such as CLAHE, for fundus images presented good potentials in enhancing the vasculature segmentation.},

  abstract = {This paper describes results from an improvement to the objective deviation angle variance technique to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones from satellite infrared imagery in the North Atlantic basin. The technique quantifies the level of organization of the infrared cloud signature of a tropical cyclone as an indirect measurement of its maximum wind speed. The major change described here is to use the National Hurricane Center’s best-track database to constrain the technique. Results are shown for the 2004–10 North Atlantic hurricane seasons and include an overall root-mean-square intensity error of 12.9 kt (6.6 m s−1, where 1 kt = 0.514 m s−1) and annual root-mean-square intensity errors ranging from 10.3 to 14.1 kt. A direct comparison between the previous version and the one reported here shows root-mean-square intensity error improvements in all years with a best improvement in 2009 from 17.9 to 10.6 kt and an overall improvement from 14.8 to 12.9 kt. In addition, samples from the 7-yr period are binned based on level of intensity and on the strength of environmental vertical wind shear as extracted from Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) data. Preliminary results suggest that the deviation angle variance technique performs best at the weakest intensity categories of tropical storm through hurricane category 3, representing 90\% of the samples, and then degrades in performance for hurricane categories 4 and 5. For environmental vertical wind shear, there is far less spread in the results with the technique performing better with increasing vertical wind shear.},

The method we propose combines the use of mutual information as the similarity measure and simulated annealing as the search technique.

By using a pyramid sampling approach combined with simulated reannealing we find that registration can be achieved to predetermined precision, subject to choice of interpolation and the constraint of time. The algorithm was tested on 49 pairs of stereo images and 48 pairs of temporal images with success.},

  abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

  abstract = {Visual tracking, in essence, deals with non-stationary image streams that change over time. While most existing algorithms are able to track objects well in controlled environments, they usually fail in the presence of significant variation of the object’s appearance or surrounding illumination. One reason for such failures is that many algorithms employ fixed appearance models of the target. Such models are trained using only appearance data available before tracking begins, which in practice limits the range of appearances that are modelled, and ignores the large volume of information (such as shape changes or specific lighting conditions) that becomes available during tracking. In this paper, we present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, efficiently adapting online to changes in the appearance of the target. The model update, based on incremental algorithms for principal component analysis, includes two important features: a method for correctly updating the sample mean, and a forgetting factor to ensure less modelling power is expended fitting older observations. Both of these features contribute measurably to improving overall tracking performance. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large changes in pose, scale, and illumination.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumors in men but prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis remains challenging. Besides whole prostate gland segmentation, the capability to differentiate between the blurry boundary of the Central Gland (CG) and Peripheral Zone (PZ) can lead to differential diagnosis, since the frequency and severity of tumors differ in these regions. To tackle the prostate zonal segmentation task, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called USE-Net, which incorporates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks into U-Net, i.e., one of the most effective CNNs in biomedical image segmentation. Especially, the SE blocks are added after every Encoder (Enc USE-Net) or Encoder-Decoder block (Enc-Dec USE-Net). This study evaluates the generalization ability of CNN-based architectures on three T2-weighted MRI datasets, each one consisting of a different number of patients and heterogeneous image characteristics, collected by different institutions. The following mixed scheme is used for training/testing: (i) training on either each individual dataset or multiple prostate MRI datasets and (ii) testing on all three datasets with all possible training/testing combinations. USE-Net is compared against three state-of-the-art CNN-based architectures (i.e., U-Net, pix2pix, and Mixed-Scale Dense Network), along with a semi-automatic continuous max-flow model. The results show that training on the union of the datasets generally outperforms training on each dataset separately, allowing for both intra-/cross-dataset generalization. Enc USE-Net shows good overall generalization under any training condition, while Enc-Dec USE-Net remarkably outperforms the other methods when trained on all datasets. These findings reveal that the SE blocks’ adaptive feature recalibration provides excellent cross-dataset generalization when testing is performed on samples of the datasets used during training. Therefore, we should consider multi-dataset training and SE blocks together as mutually indispensable methods to draw out each other’s full potential. In conclusion, adaptive mechanisms (e.g., feature recalibration) may be a valuable solution in medical imaging applications involving multi-institutional settings.},

Deep neural networks have shown the same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be transparent, robust, fair, and ensure accountability. Current deep neural solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the specifics concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need to ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be incorporated into the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various interpretability methods. Finally, we discuss limitations, provide guidelines for using interpretability methods and future directions concerning the interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.},

  abstract = {Objective No method of grading visual field (VF) defects has been widely accepted throughout the glaucoma community. The SCHEIE (Systematic Classification of Humphrey visual fields-Easy Interpretation and Evaluation) grading system for glaucomatous visual fields was created to convey qualitative and quantitative information regarding visual field defects in an objective, reproducible, and easily applicable manner for research purposes. Methods The SCHEIE grading system is composed of a qualitative and quantitative score. The qualitative score consists of designation in one or more of the following categories: normal, central scotoma, paracentral scotoma, paracentral crescent, temporal quadrant, nasal quadrant, peripheral arcuate defect, expansive arcuate, or altitudinal defect. The quantitative component incorporates the Humphrey visual field index (VFI), location of visual defects for superior and inferior hemifields, and blind spot involvement. Accuracy and speed at grading using the qualitative and quantitative components was calculated for non-physician graders. Results Graders had a median accuracy of 96.67\% for their qualitative scores and a median accuracy of 98.75\% for their quantitative scores. Graders took a mean of 56 seconds per visual field to assign a qualitative score and 20 seconds per visual field to assign a quantitative score. Conclusion The SCHEIE grading system is a reproducible tool that combines qualitative and quantitative measurements to grade glaucomatous visual field defects. The system aims to standardize clinical staging and to make specific visual field defects more easily identifiable. Specific patterns of visual field loss may also be associated with genetic variants in future genetic analysis.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a method for automatic detection of microaneurysms in digital eye fundus image is described. To develop an automated diabetic retinopathy screening system, a detection of dark lesions in digital fundus photographs is needed. Microaneurysms are the first clinical sign of diabetic retinopathy and they appear small red dots on retinal fundus images. The number of microaneurysms is used to indicate the severity of the disease. Early microaneurysm detection can help reduce the incidence of blindness. Here, we have discussed a method for the automatic detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (ADDR) in color fundus images. Different preprocessing, feature extraction and classification algorithms are used. The performance of the automated system is assessed based on Sensitivity and Specificity. The Sensitivity and Specificity of this approach are 94.44 \% and 87.5 \%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Many underlying relationships among data in several areas of science and engineering, e.g., computer vision, molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern recognition, and data mining, can be represented in terms of graphs. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.},

  abstract = {Purpose Development and validation of a fully automated method to detect and quantify macular fluid in conventional OCT images. Design Development of a diagnostic modality. Participants The clinical dataset for fluid detection consisted of 1200 OCT volumes of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD, n~= 400), diabetic macular edema (DME, n~= 400), or retinal vein occlusion (RVO, n~= 400) acquired with Zeiss Cirrus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) (n~= 600) or Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) (n~= 600) OCT devices. Methods A method based on deep learning to automatically detect and quantify intraretinal cystoid fluid (IRC) and subretinal fluid (SRF) was developed. The performance of the algorithm in accurately identifying fluid localization and extent was evaluated against a manual consensus reading of 2 masked reading center graders. Main Outcome Measures Performance of a fully automated method to accurately detect, differentiate, and quantify intraretinal and SRF using area under the receiver operating characteristics curves, precision, and recall. Results The newly designed, fully automated diagnostic method based on deep learning achieved optimal accuracy for the detection and quantification of IRC for all 3 macular pathologies with a mean accuracy (AUC) of 0.94 (range, 0.91–0.97), a mean precision of 0.91, and a mean recall of 0.84. The detection and measurement of SRF were also highly accurate with an AUC of 0.92 (range, 0.86–0.98), a mean precision of 0.61, and a mean recall of 0.81, with superior performance in neovascular AMD and RVO compared with DME, which was represented rarely in the population studied. High linear correlation was confirmed between automated and manual fluid localization and quantification, yielding an average Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.90 for IRC and of 0.96 for SRF. Conclusions Deep learning in retinal image analysis achieves excellent accuracy for the differential detection of retinal fluid types across the most prevalent exudative macular diseases and OCT devices. Furthermore, quantification of fluid achieves a high level of concordance with manual expert assessment. Fully automated analysis of retinal OCT images from clinical routine provides a promising horizon in improving accuracy and reliability of retinal diagnosis for research and clinical practice in ophthalmology.},

  abstract = {While millions of individuals show early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) signs, yet have excellent vision, the risk of progression to advanced AMD with legal blindness is highly variable. We suggest means of artificial intelligence to individually predict AMD progression.    In eyes with intermediate AMD, progression to the neovascular type with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or the dry type with geographic atrophy (GA) was diagnosed based on standardized monthly optical coherence tomography (OCT) images by independent graders. We obtained automated volumetric segmentation of outer neurosensory layers and retinal pigment epithelium, drusen, and hyperreflective foci by spectral domain-OCT image analysis. Using imaging, demographic, and genetic input features, we developed and validated a machine learning–based predictive model assessing the risk of conversion to advanced AMD.    Of a total of 495 eyes, 159 eyes (32\%) had converted to advanced AMD within 2 years, 114 eyes progressed to CNV, and 45 to GA. Our predictive model differentiated converting versus nonconverting eyes with a performance of 0.68 and 0.80 for CNV and GA, respectively. The most critical quantitative features for progression were outer retinal thickness, hyperreflective foci, and drusen area. The features for conversion showed pathognomonic patterns that were distinctly different for the neovascular and the atrophic pathways. Predictive hallmarks for CNV were mostly drusen-centric, while GA markers were associated with neurosensory retina and age.    Artificial intelligence with automated analysis of imaging biomarkers allows personalized prediction of AMD progression. Moreover, pathways of progression may be specific in respect to the neovascular/atrophic type.},

  abstract = {Purpose To present the routine use of OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) for the objective diagnosis and monitoring of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Design Retrospective, observational case series. Participants Patients with diabetic retinopathy imaged using a standardized PDR protocol. Methods Patients routinely imaged with a standardized PDR protocol between March 2017 and January 2019 were included. This included a 12×9-mm structural OCT volume centered on the macula and a 6×6-mm OCTA scan centered on the optic nerve head obtained using a Topcon swept-source system (DRI OCT-1 Triton, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (FA) was also performed when clinically indicated. The ground truth for each case was determined by merging the findings from biomicroscopy and imaging modalities to generate the maximum level of detection for each finding. Main Outcome Measures Detection rates of new-onset, regression, and reactivation of neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) using different modalities (biomicroscopy/color photography, structural OCT, B-scan OCTA, en face OCTA). Detection of progression of tractional retinal detachment (TRD). Results A total of 383 eyes of 204 patients were evaluated. After excluding patients without PDR or with insufficient image quality, 47 eyes of 35 patients were included. For the detection of new-onset NVD and NVE, structural OCT had the highest detection rate (100\%) of all modalities. However, for the detection of regression or reactivation of neovascularization (NV), B-scan OCTA had the highest detection rate (100\%). Structural OCT detected regression only in 45.5\% of cases, resulting in a low detection rate of reactivation (12.5\%). Among 10 eyes with TRD, OCT detected fovea-threatening TRD during follow-up in 7 eyes, resulting in vitrectomy. Conclusions This study demonstrates the utility of novel multimodal imaging in the daily management of patients with PDR. Posterior pole structural OCT had the best detection rate for NV, and B-scan OCTA showed the most potential for objective monitoring of disease after treatment.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing `visual explanations' for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for `dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad- CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

In this paper, a novel method for automatic detection of both microaneurysms and hemorrhages in color fundus images is described and validated. The main contribution is a new set of shape features, called Dynamic Shape Features, that do not require precise segmentation of the regions to be classified. These features represent the evolution of the shape during image flooding and allow to discriminate between lesions and vessel segments. The method is validated per-lesion and per-image using six databases, four of which are publicly available. It proves to be robust with respect to variability in image resolution, quality and acquisition system. On the Retinopathy Online Challenge's database, the method achieves a FROC score of 0.420 which ranks it fourth. On the Messidor database, when detecting images with diabetic retinopathy, the proposed method achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.899, comparable to the score of human experts, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

In supervised machine learning, a mathematical function is constructed via automated analysis of training data, which consists of input features (such as retinal images) and output labels (such as the grade of macular edema). With large training data sets and minimal human guidance, a computer learns to generalize from the information contained in the training data. The result is a mathematical function, a model, that can be used to map a new record to the corresponding diagnosis, such as an image to grade macular edema. Although machine learning–based models for classification or for predicting a future health state are being developed for diverse clinical applications, evidence is lacking that deployment of these models has improved care and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a novel computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) system for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scans. The CAD system is based on fusing novel OCT markers that describe both the morphology/anatomy and the reflectivity of retinal layers to improve DR diagnosis. This system separates retinal layers automatically using a segmentation approach based on an adaptive appearance and their prior shape information. High-order morphological and novel reflectivity markers are extracted from individual segmented layers. Namely, the morphological markers are layer thickness and tortuosity while the reflectivity markers are the 1st-order reflectivity of the layer in addition to local and global high-order reflectivity based on Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), respectively. The extracted image-derived markers are represented using cumulative distribution function (CDF) descriptors. The constructed CDFs are then described using their statistical measures, i.e., the 10th through 90th percentiles with a 10\% increment. For individual layer classification, each extracted descriptor of a given layer is fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel. The results of the four classifiers are then fused using a backpropagation neural network (BNN) to diagnose each retinal layer. For global subject diagnosis, classification outputs (probabilities) of the twelve layers are fused using another BNN to make the final diagnosis of the B-scan. This system is validated and tested on 130 patients, with two scans for both eyes (i.e. 260 OCT images), with a balanced number of normal and DR subjects using different validation metrics: 2-folds, 4-folds, 10-folds, and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approaches. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. The system’s performance after the fusion of these different markers showed better performance compared with individual markers and other machine learning fusion methods. Namely, it achieved \$\$96.15\textbackslash\%\$\$, \$\$99.23\textbackslash\%\$\$, \$\$97.66\textbackslash\%\$\$, and \$\$97.69\textbackslash\%\$\$, respectively, using the LOSO cross-validation technique. The reported results, based on the integration of morphology and reflectivity markers and by using state-of-the-art machine learning classifications, demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to diagnose the DR early.},

We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

  abstract = {Abstract Aims The aim was to develop an automated screening system to analyse digital colour retinal images for important features of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Methods High performance pre-processing of the colour images was performed. Previously described automated image analysis systems were used to detect major landmarks of the retinal image (optic disc, blood vessels and fovea). Recursive region growing segmentation algorithms combined with the use of a new technique, termed a ?Moat Operator?, were used to automatically detect features of NPDR. These features included haemorrhages and microaneurysms (HMA), which were treated as one group, and hard exudates as another group. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated by comparison with an experienced fundoscopist. Results The algorithm for exudate recognition was applied to 30 retinal images of which 21 contained exudates and nine were without pathology. The sensitivity and specificity for exudate detection were 88.5\% and 99.7\%, respectively, when compared with the ophthalmologist. HMA were present in 14 retinal images. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 77.5\% and specificity of 88.7\% for detection of HMA. Conclusions Fully automated computer algorithms were able to detect hard exudates and HMA. This paper presents encouraging results in automatic identification of important features of NPDR. Diabet. Med. 19, 105?112 (2002)},

In the case of an image classifier, one type of explanation is to identify pixels that strongly influence the final decision. A starting point for this strategy is the gradient of the class score function with respect to the input image. This gradient can be interpreted as a sensitivity map, and there are several techniques that elaborate on this basic idea. This paper makes two contributions: it introduces SmoothGrad, a simple method that can help visually sharpen gradient-based sensitivity maps, and it discusses lessons in the visualization of these maps. We publish the code for our experiments and a website with our results.}

However, the quality of data labels is a concern because of the lack of high-quality labels in many real-world scenarios. As noisy labels severely degrade the generalization performance of deep neural networks, learning from noisy labels (robust training) is becoming an important task in modern deep learning applications. In this survey, we first describe the problem of learning with label noise from a supervised learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of 62 state-of-the-art robust training methods, all of which are categorized into five groups according to their methodological difference, followed by a systematic comparison of six properties used to evaluate their superiority. Subsequently, we perform an in-depth analysis of noise rate estimation and summarize the typically used evaluation methodology, including public noisy datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we present several promising research directions that can serve as a guideline for future studies.},

Design Consensus meeting. Participants An international panel of retina specialists, imaging and image reading center experts, and ocular pathologists. Methods During several meetings organized under the auspices of the Macula Society, an international study group discussed and codified a set nomenclature framework for classifying the subtypes of neovascular AMD and associated lesion components. Main Outcome Measures A consensus classification of neovascular AMD. Results The study group created a standardized working definition of AMD. The components of neovascular AMD were defined and subclassified. Disease consequences of macular neovascularization were delineated. Conclusions The framework of a consensus nomenclature system, a definition of AMD, and a delineation of the subtypes of neovascular AMD were developed. Establishing a uniform set of definitions will facilitate comparison of diverse patient groups and different studies. The framework presented is modified and updated readily, processes that are anticipated to occur on a periodic basis. The study group suggests that the consensus standards outlined in this article be used in future reported studies of neovascular AMD and clinical practice.},

For this reason, articles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem to be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on this idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies, leading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this paper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies of XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as well as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is intended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies face. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not be sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend this problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions: a new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of XAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.},

We run a series of experiments showing the effect of different kinds of Dropout training on the DeepLabv3+ image segmentation model when trained using a small dataset. We find that when appropriate forms of Dropout are applied in the right place in the model architecture that non-insignificant improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score can be observed. In our best case, we find that applying Dropout scheduling in conjunction with SpatialDropout improves baseline mIoU from 0.49 to 0.59. This result shows that even where a model architecture makes extensive use of Batch Normalization, Dropout can still be an effective way of improving performance in low data situations.},

However, network training becomes more difficult with increasing depth and training of very deep networks remains an open problem. In this extended abstract, we introduce a new architecture designed to ease gradient-based training of very deep networks. We refer to networks with this architecture as highway networks, since they allow unimpeded information flow across several layers on "information highways". The architecture is characterized by the use of gating units which learn to regulate the flow of information through a network. Highway networks with hundreds of layers can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent and with a variety of activation functions, opening up the possibility of studying extremely deep and efficient architectures.},

This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al. . The results show that our method is significantly better than the two rule-based methods (p{$<$}0.01). The accuracy of our method is 0.944 versus 0.947 for a second observer.},

Deep-learning segmentation frameworks rely not only on the choice of network architecture but also on the choice of loss function. When the segmentation process targets rare observations, a severe class imbalance is likely to occur between candidate labels, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In order to mitigate this issue, strategies such as the weighted cross-entropy function, the sensitivity function or the Dice loss function, have been proposed. In this work, we investigate the behavior of these loss functions and their sensitivity to learning rate tuning in the presence of different rates of label imbalance across 2D and 3D segmentation tasks. We also propose to use the class re-balancing properties of the Generalized Dice overlap, a known metric for segmentation assessment, as a robust and accurate deep-learning loss function for unbalanced tasks.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental axioms— Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

  abstract = {Purpose To prospectively determine the relationship of OCT angiography (OCTA) metrics to diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression and development of diabetic macular edema (DME). Design Prospective, observational study. Participants A total of 205 eyes from 129 patients with diabetes mellitus followed up for at least 2 years. Methods All participants underwent OCTA with a swept-source OCT device (DRI-OCT Triton, Topcon, Inc, Tokyo, Japan). Individual OCTA images of superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were generated by IMAGEnet6 (Basic License 10). After a quality check, automated measurements of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, FAZ circularity, vessel density (VD), and fractal dimension (FD) of both SCP and DCP were then obtained. Main Outcome Measures Progression of DR and development of DME. Results Over a median follow-up of 27.14 months (interquartile range, 24.16–30.41 months), 28 of the 205 eyes (13.66\%) developed DR progression. Of the 194 eyes without DME at baseline, 17 (8.76\%) developed DME. Larger FAZ area (hazard ratio [HR], 1.829 per SD increase; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.332–2.512), lower VD (HR, 1.908 per SD decrease; 95\% CI, 1.303–2.793), and lower FD (HR, 4.464 per SD decrease; 95\% CI, 1.337–14.903) of DCP were significantly associated with DR progression after adjusting for established risk factors (DR severity, glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, age, and mean arterial blood pressure at baseline). Lower VD of SCP (HR, 1.789 per SD decrease; 95\% CI, 1.027–4.512) was associated with DME development. Compared with the model with established risk factors alone, the addition of OCTA metrics improved the predictive discrimination of DR progression (FAZ area of DCP, C-statistics 0.723 vs. 0.677, P~{$<~$}0.001; VD of DCP, C-statistics 0.727 vs. 0.677, P~= 0.001; FD of DCP, C-statistics 0.738 vs. 0.677, P {$<$} 0.001) and DME development (VD of SCP, C-statistics 0.904 vs. 0.875, P~= 0.036). Conclusions The FAZ area, VD, and FD of DCP predict DR progression, whereas VD of SCP predicts DME development. Our findings provide evidence to support that OCTA metrics improve the evaluation of risk of DR progression and DME development beyond traditional risk factors.},

  abstract = {Human eye is one of the important organs in human body, with iris, pupil, sclera, cornea, lens, retina and optic nerve. Many important eye diseases as well as systemic diseases manifest themselves in the retina. The most widespread causes of blindness in the industrialized world are glaucoma, Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macula Edema (DME). The development of a retinal image analysis system is a demanding research topic for early detection, progression analysis and diagnosis of eye diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases are essential to prevent vision loss. The huge and growing number of retinal disease affected patients, cost of current hospital-based detection methods (by eye care specialists) and scarcity in the number of ophthalmologists are the barriers to achieve the recommended screening compliance in the patient who is at the risk of retinal diseases. Developing an automated system which uses pattern recognition, computer vision and machine learning to diagnose retinal diseases is a potential solution to this problem. Damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina in the posterior part of the eye due to diabetes is named as DR. Diabetes is a disease which occurs when the pancreas does not secrete enough insulin or the body does not utilize it properly. This disease slowly affects the circulatory system including that of the retina. As diabetes intensifies, the vision of a patient may start deteriorating and leading to DR. The retinal landmarks like OD and blood vessels, white lesions and red lesions are segmented to develop automated screening system for DR. DME is an advanced symptom of DR that can lead to irreversible vision loss. DME is a general term defined as retinal thickening or exudates present within 2 disk diameter of the fovea center; it can either focal or diffuse DME in distribution. In this paper, review the algorithms used in diagnosis of DR and DME.},

  abstract = {The number of patients with type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly in both developed and developing countries around the world. The emerging pandemic is driven by the combined effects of population ageing, rising levels of obesity and inactivity, and greater longevity among patients with diabetes that is attributable to improved management. The vascular complications of type 2 diabetes account for the majority of the social and economic burden among patients and society more broadly. This review summarizes the burden of type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and their vascular complications. It is projected that by 2025 there will be 380 million people with type 2 diabetes and 418 million people with impaired glucose tolerance. Diabetes is a major global cause of premature mortality that is widely underestimated, because only a minority of persons with diabetes dies from a cause uniquely related to the condition. Approximately one half of patients with type 2 diabetes die prematurely of a cardiovascular cause and approximately 10\% die of renal failure. Global excess mortality attributable to diabetes in adults was estimated to be 3.8 million deaths. Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil 17 (Suppl 1):S3-S8 © 2010 The European Society of Cardiology},

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2\% top-1 and 5:6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3:5\% top-5 error and 17:3\% top-1 error on the validation set and 3:6\% top-5 error on the official test set.},

Computer-aided diagnosis can aid human graders to cope with this mounting problem. We propose to use a 10-layer convolutional neural network to automatically, simultaneously segment and discriminate exudates, haemorrhages and micro-aneurysms. Input image is normalized before segmentation. The net is trained in two stages to improve performance. On average, our net on 30,275,903 effective points achieved a sensitivity of 0.8758 and 0.7158 for exudates and dark lesions on the CLEOPATRA database. It also achieved a sensitivity of 0.6257 and 0.4606 for haemorrhages and micro-aneurysms. This study shows that it is possible to get a single convolutional neural network to segment these pathological features on a wide range of fundus images with reasonable accuracy.},

Existing algorithms designed to deal with piecewise planar surfaces with distinct features and Lambertian reflectance do not apply in applications such as 3D reconstruction of medical images including stereo retinal images. In this paper, robust pixel feature vectors are formulated to extract discriminative features in the presence of noise in scale space, through which the response of low-frequency mechanisms alter and interact with the response of high-frequency mechanisms. The deep structures of the scene are represented with the evolution of disparity estimates in scale space, which distributes the matching ambiguity along the scale dimension to obtain globally coherent reconstructions. The performance is verified both qualitatively by face validity and quantitatively on our collection of stereo fundus image sets with ground truth, which have been made publicly available as an extension of standard test images for performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {TOPIC: To provide updated estimates on the global prevalence and number of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR) through~2045. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated the global population with diabetes mellitus (DM) to be 463 million in 2019 and 700 million in 2045. Diabetic retinopathy remains a common complication of DM and a leading cause of preventable blindness in the adult working population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus for population-based studies published up to March 2020. Random effect meta-analysis with logit transformation was performed to estimate global and regional prevalence of DR, vision-threatening DR (VTDR), and clinically significant macular edema (CSME). Projections of DR, VTDR, and CSME burden were based on population data from the IDF Atlas~2019. RESULTS: We included 59 population-based studies. Among individuals with diabetes, global prevalence was 22.27\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 19.73\%-25.03\%) for DR, 6.17\% (95\% CI, 5.43\%-6.98\%) for VTDR, and 4.07\% (95\% CI, 3.42\%-4.82\%) for CSME. In 2020, the number of adults worldwide with DR, VTDR, and CSME was estimated to be 103.12 million, 28.54 million, and 18.83 million, respectively; by 2045, the numbers are projected to increase to 160.50 million, 44.82 million, and 28.61 million, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy prevalence was highest in Africa (35.90\%) and North American and the Caribbean (33.30\%) and was lowest in South and Central America (13.37\%). In meta-regression models adjusting for habitation type, response rate, study year, and DR diagnostic method, Hispanics (odds ratio [OR], 2.92; 95\% CI, 1.22-6.98) and Middle Easterners (OR, 2.44; 95\% CI, 1.51-3.94) with diabetes were more likely to have DR compared with Asians. DISCUSSION: The global DR burden is expected to remain high through 2045, disproportionately affecting countries in the Middle East and North Africa and the Western Pacific. These updated estimates may guide DR screening, treatment, and public health care strategies.},

Ces modèles sont constitués par la donnée de sommets (aussi appelés nœuds ou points, en référence aux polyèdres), et d'arêtes (aussi appelées liens ou lignes) entre ces sommets ; ces arêtes sont parfois non-symétriques (les graphes sont alors dits orientés) et sont appelés des flèches. Les algorithmes élaborés pour résoudre des problèmes concernant les objets de cette théorie ont de nombreuses applications dans tous les domaines liés à la notion de réseau (réseau social, réseau informatique, télécommunications, etc.) et dans bien d'autres domaines (par exemple génétique) tant le concept de graphe, à peu près équivalent à celui de relation binaire (à ne pas confondre donc avec graphe d'une fonction), est général. De grands théorèmes difficiles, comme le théorème des quatre couleurs, le théorème des graphes parfaits, ou encore le théorème de Robertson-Seymour, ont contribué à asseoir cette matière auprès des mathématiciens, et les questions qu'elle laisse ouvertes, comme la conjecture de Hadwiger, en font une branche vivace des mathématiques discrètes.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Determine the frequency of and the predictive factors for abnormal ocular fundus findings among emergency department (ED) headache patients. Methods: Cross-sectional study of prospectively enrolled adult patients presenting to our ED with a chief complaint of headache. Ocular fundus photographs were obtained using a nonmydriatic fundus camera that does not require pupillary dilation. Demographic and neuroimaging information was collected. Photographs were reviewed independently by 2 neuroophthalmologists for findings relevant to acute care. The results were analyzed using univariate statistics and logistic regression modeling. Results: We included 497 patients (median age: 40 years, 73\% women), among whom 42 (8.5\%, 95\% confidence interval: 6\%–11\%) had ocular fundus abnormalities. Of these 42 patients, 12 had disc edema, 9 had optic nerve pallor, 6 had grade III/IV hypertensive retinopathy, and 15 had isolated retinal hemorrhages. Body mass index ≥35 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3, p = 0.02), younger age (OR: 0.7 per 10-year increase, p = 0.02), and higher mean arterial blood pressure (OR: 1.3 per 10-mm Hg increase, p = 0.003) were predictive of abnormal retinal photography. Patients with an abnormal fundus had a higher percentage of hospital admission (21\% vs 10\%, p = 0.04). Among the 34 patients with abnormal ocular fundi who had brain imaging, 14 (41\%) had normal imaging. Conclusions: Ocular fundus abnormalities were found in 8.5\% of patients with headache presenting to our ED. Predictors of abnormal funduscopic findings included higher body mass index, younger age, and higher blood pressure. Our study confirms the importance of funduscopic examination in patients with headache, particularly in the ED, and reaffirms the utility of nonmydriatic fundus photography in this setting.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades a significant number of OCT segmentation approaches have been proposed in the literature. Each methodology has been conceived for and/or evaluated using specific datasets that do not reflect the complexities of the majority of widely available retinal features observed in clinical settings. In addition, there does not exist an appropriate OCT dataset with ground truth that reflects the realities of everyday retinal features observed in clinical settings. While the need for unbiased performance evaluation of automated segmentation algorithms is obvious, the validation process of segmentation algorithms have been usually performed by comparing with manual labelings from each study and there has been a lack of common ground truth. Therefore, a performance comparison of different algorithms using the same ground truth has never been performed. This paper reviews research-oriented tools for automated segmentation of the retinal tissue on OCT images. It also evaluates and compares the performance of these software tools with a common ground truth.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI ‘black-box’ algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need for multimodal image registration in ophthalmology, this paper introduces an algorithm which is tailored to jointly align in a common reference space all the images in a complete fluorescein angiogram (FA) sequence, which contains both red-free (RF) and FA images. Our work is inspired by Generalized Dual-Bootstrap Iterative Closest Point (GDB-ICP), which rank-orders Lowe keypoint matches and refines the transformation, going from local and low-order to global and higher-order model, computed from each keypoint match in succession. Albeit GDB-ICP has been shown to be robust in registering images taken under different lighting conditions, the performance is not satisfactory for image pairs with substantial, nonlinear intensity differences. Our algorithm, named Edge-Driven DB-ICP, targeting the least reliable component of GDB-ICP, modifies generation of keypoint matches for initialization by extracting the Lowe keypoints from the gradient magnitude image and enriching the keypoint descriptor with global-shape context using the edge points. Our dataset consists of 60 randomly-selected pathological sequences, each on average having up to two RF and 13 FA images. Edge-Driven DB-ICP successfully registered 92.4\% of all pairs, and 81.1\% multimodal pairs, whereas GDB-ICP registered 80.1\% and 40.1\%, respectively. For the joint registration of all images in a sequence, Edge-Driven DB-ICP succeeded in 59 sequences, which is a 23\% improvement over GDB-ICP.},

Early detection and treatment are necessary in order to delay or avoid vision deterioration and vision loss. To that end, many artificial-intelligence-powered methods have been proposed by the research community for the detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy on fundus retina images. This review article provides a thorough analysis of the use of deep learning methods at the various steps of the diabetic retinopathy detection pipeline based on fundus images. We discuss several aspects of that pipeline, ranging from the datasets that are widely used by the research community, the preprocessing techniques employed and how these accelerate and improve the models' performance, to the development of such deep learning models for the diagnosis and grading of the disease as well as the localization of the disease's lesions. We also discuss certain models that have been applied in real clinical settings. Finally, we conclude with some important insights and provide future research directions.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, deep convolutional neural networks have been widely adopted for medical image segmentation and shown to achieve adequate performance. However, due to inherent inductive biases present in convolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies in the image. Recently proposed transformer-based architectures that leverage self-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn representations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore transformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using transformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks. Majority of existing transformer-based network architectures proposed for vision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However, compared to the datasets for vision applications, in medical imaging the number of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently train transformers for medical imaging applications. To this end, we propose a gated axial-attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing an additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to train the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global training strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically, we operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features, respectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three different medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves better performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based architectures.

Results of the IDx-DR device and experts were compared using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), distinguishing between referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) and vision-threatening retinopathy (VTDR).

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deep learning network architectures that have pushed forward the state-of-the-art in a range of computer vision applications and are increasingly popular in medical image analysis. However, training of CNNs is time-consuming and challenging. In medical image analysis tasks, the majority of training examples are easy to classify and therefore contribute little to the CNN learning process. In this paper, we propose a method to improve and speed-up the CNN training for medical image analysis tasks by dynamically selecting misclassified negative samples during training. Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples are more likely to be included in the next CNN training iteration. We evaluated and compared our proposed method by training a CNN with (SeS) and without (NSeS) the selective sampling method. We focus on the detection of hemorrhages in color fundus images.

  abstract = {The standard method for estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones is based on satellite observations (Dvorak technique) and is utilized operationally by tropical analysis centers around the world. The technique relies on image pattern recognition along with analyst interpretation of empirically based rules regarding the vigor and organization of convection surrounding the storm center. While this method performs well enough in most cases to be employed operationally, there are situations when analyst judgment can lead to discrepancies between different analysis centers estimating the same storm. In an attempt to eliminate this subjectivity, a computer-based algorithm that operates objectively on digital infrared information has been developed. An original version of this algorithm (engineered primarily by the third author) has been significantly modified and advanced to include selected “Dvorak rules,” additional constraints, and a time-averaging scheme. This modified version, the Objective Dvorak Technique (ODT), is applicable to tropical cyclones that have attained tropical storm or hurricane strength. The performance of the ODT is evaluated on cases from the 1995 and 1996 Atlantic hurricane seasons. Reconnaissance aircraft measurements of minimum surface pressure are used to validate the satellite-based estimates. Statistical analysis indicates the technique to be competitive with, and in some cases superior to, the Dvorak-based intensity estimates produced operationally by satellite analysts from tropical analysis centers. Further analysis reveals situations where the algorithm needs improvement, and directions for future research and modifications are suggested.},

In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-theart results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a proteinprotein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

The main changes over the last twenty years are the shift from extrinsic to intrinsic registration, the primacy of intensity-based registration, the breakthrough of nonlinear registration, the progress of inter-subject registration, and the availability of generic image registration software packages. Two problems that were called urgent already 20 years ago, are even more urgent nowadays: Validation of registration methods, and translation of results of image registration research to clinical practice. It may be concluded that the field of medical image registration has evolved, but still is in need of further development in various aspects.},

To evaluate the presence of hyperreflective spots (HRS) in diabetic patients without clinically detectable retinopathy (no DR) or with nonproliferative mild to moderate retinopathy (DR) without macular edema, and compare the results to controls. Methods. 36 subjects were enrolled: 12 with no DR, 12 with DR, and 12 normal subjects who served as controls. All studied subjects underwent full ophthalmologic examination and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). SD-OCT images were analyzed to measure and localize HRS. Each image was analyzed by two independent, masked examiners. Results. The number of HRS was significantly higher in both diabetics without and with retinopathy versus controls ( ) and in diabetics with retinopathy versus diabetics without retinopathy ( ). The HRS were mainly located in the inner retina layers (inner limiting membrane, ganglion cell layer, and inner nuclear layer). The intraobserver and interobserver agreement was almost perfect ( ). Conclusions. SD-OCT hyperreflective spots are present in diabetic eyes even when clinical retinopathy is undetectable. Their number increases with progressing retinopathy. Initially, HRS are mainly located in the inner retina, where the resident microglia is present. With progressing retinopathy, HRS reach the outer retinal layer. HRS may represent a surrogate of microglial activation in diabetic retina.},

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease that, if not diagnosed at an early stage, can cause vision loss and blindness in diabetic patients. Therefore, in the field of ophthalmology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is widely used in the early diagnosis and treatment of DR. However, it is arduous and time consuming to manually classify and detect DR from retinal OCT image. In this context, this paper proposed a deep convolutional neural network combined with Bidirectional long-short term memory and support vector machine (CNN-BiLSTM+SVM) for automatic DR classification from OCT image. Here, CNN-BiLSTM architecture is used as feature extractor where CNN extracts the local features and BiLSTM learns correlation among the extracted features. SVM is subsequently trained to diagnose diabetic retinopathy using the extracted features. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed on blind test dataset of 1000 images (250 per class) labeled into four classes. The proposed model has attained satisfactory results in the classification of diabetic retinopathy, with an accuracy of 99.30\%, which also proves its competitiveness in comparison to other existing state-of-the-art.},

Projection-resolved optical coherence tomographic angiography (PR-OCTA) enables both cross-sectional and en face visualization of CNV. However, CNV identification and segmentation remains difficult even with PR-OCTA due to the presence of residual artifacts. In this paper, a fully automated CNV diagnosis and segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is described. This study used a clinical dataset, including both scans with and without CNV, and scans of eyes with different pathologies. Furthermore, no scans were excluded due to image quality. In testing, all CNV cases were diagnosed from non-CNV controls with 100\&\#x0025; sensitivity and 95\&\#x0025; specificity. The mean intersection over union of CNV membrane segmentation was as high as 0.88. By enabling fully automated categorization and segmentation, the proposed algorithm should offer benefits for CNV diagnosis, visualization monitoring.},

  abstract = {Skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images is of great importance for improving the quantitative analysis of skin cancer. However, the automatic segmentation of melanoma is a very challenging task owing to the large variation of melanoma and ambiguous boundaries of lesion areas. While convolutional neutral networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable progress in this task, most of existing solutions are still incapable of effectively capturing global dependencies to counteract the inductive bias caused by limited receptive fields. Recently, transformers have been proposed as a promising tool for global context modeling by employing a powerful global attention mechanism, but one of their main shortcomings when applied to segmentation tasks is that they cannot effectively extract sufficient local details to tackle ambiguous boundaries. We propose a novel boundary-aware transformer (BAT) to comprehensively address the challenges of automatic skin lesion segmentation. Specifically, we integrate a new boundary-wise attention gate (BAG) into transformers to enable the whole network to not only effectively model global long-range dependencies via transformers but also, simultaneously, capture more local details by making full use of boundary-wise prior knowledge. Particularly, the auxiliary supervision of BAG is capable of assisting transformers to learn position embedding as it provides much spatial information. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed BAT and experiments corroborate its effectiveness, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in two famous datasets (Code is available at https://github.com/jcwang123/BA-Transformer).},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising high-speed, non-invasive imaging modality providing high-resolution retinal scans. However, a variety of external factors such as light occlusion and patient movement can seriously degrade OCT image quality, which complicates manual retinopathy detection and computer-aided diagnosis. As such, this study first presents an OCT image quality assessment (OCT-IQA) system, capable of automatic classification based on signal completeness, location, and effectiveness. Four CNN architectures (VGG-16, Inception-V3, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50) from the ImageNet classification task were used to train the proposed OCT-IQA system via transfer learning. The ResNet-50 with the best performance was then integrated into the final OCT-IQA network. The usefulness of this approach was evaluated using retinopathy detection results. A retinopathy classification network was first trained by fine-tuning Inception-V3 model. The model was then applied to two test datasets, created randomly from the original dataset, one of which was screened by the OCT-IQA system and only included high quality images while the other was mixed by high and low quality images. Results showed that retinopathy detection accuracy and area under curve (AUC) were 3.75\&\#x0025; and 1.56\&\#x0025; higher, respectively, for the filtered data (compared with the unfiltered data). These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OCT-IQA system and suggest that deep learning could be applied to the design of computer-aided systems (CADSs) for automatic retinopathy detection.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in the optical coherence tomography (OCT) image classification task with substantial labelled B-scan images available. However, obtaining such fine-grained expert annotations is usually quite difficult and expensive. How to leverage the volume-level labels to develop a robust classifier is very appealing. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework with uncertainty estimation to address the macula-related disease classification problem from OCT images with the only volume-level label being available. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based instance-level classifier is iteratively refined by using the proposed uncertainty-driven deep multiple instance learning scheme. To our best knowledge, we are the first to incorporate the uncertainty evaluation mechanism into multiple instance learning (MIL) for training a robust instance classifier. The classifier is able to detect suspicious abnormal instances and abstract the corresponding deep embedding with high representation capability simultaneously. Second, a recurrent neural network (RNN) takes instance features from the same bag as input and generates the final bag-level prediction by considering the individually local instance information and globally aggregated bag-level representation. For more comprehensive validation, we built two large diabetic macular edema (DME) OCT datasets from different devices and imaging protocols to evaluate the efficacy of our method, which are composed of 30,151 B-scans in 1,396 volumes from 274 patients (Heidelberg-DME dataset) and 38,976 B-scans in 3,248 volumes from 490 patients (Triton-DME dataset), respectively. We compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art approaches, and experimentally demonstrate that our method is superior to alternative methods, achieving volume-level accuracy, F1-score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 95.1\%, 0.939 and 0.990 on Heidelberg-DME and those of 95.1\%, 0.935 and 0.986 on Triton-DME, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also yields competitive results on another public age-related macular degeneration OCT dataset, indicating the high potential as an effective screening tool in the clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Lesion detection is a critical component of disease diagnosis, but the manual segmentation of lesions in medical images is time-consuming and experience-demanding. These issues have recently been addressed through deep learning models. However, most of the existing algorithms were developed using supervised training, which requires time-intensive manual labeling and prevents the model from detecting unaware lesions. As such, this study proposes a weakly supervised learning network based on CycleGAN for lesions segmentation in full-width optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The model was trained to reconstruct underlying normal anatomic structures from abnormal input images, then the lesions can be detected by calculating the difference between the input and output images. A customized network architecture and a multi-scale similarity perceptual reconstruction loss were used to extend the CycleGAN model to transfer between objects exhibiting shape deformations. The proposed technique was validated using an open-source retinal OCT image dataset. Image-level anomaly detection and pixel-level lesion detection results were assessed using area-under-curve (AUC) and the Dice similarity coefficient, producing results of 96.94\% and 0.8239, respectively, higher than all comparative methods. The average test time required to generate a single full-width image was 0.039 s, which is shorter than that reported in recent studies. These results indicate that our model can accurately detect and segment retinopathy lesions in real-time, without the need for supervised labeling. And we hope this method will be helpful to accelerate the clinical diagnosis process and reduce the misdiagnosis rate.},

  abstract = {Early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of patients suffering from eye diseases have been major concerns in the computer-aided detection techniques. Detecting one or several specific types of retinal lesions has made a significant breakthrough in computer-aided screen in the past few decades. However, due to the variety of retinal lesions and complex normal anatomical structures, automatic detection of lesions with unknown and diverse types from a retina remains a challenging task. In this paper, a weakly supervised method, requiring only a series of normal and abnormal retinal images without need to specifically annotate their locations and types, is proposed for this task. Specifically, a fundus image is understood as a superposition of background, blood vessels, and background noise (lesions included for abnormal images). Background is formulated as a low-rank structure after a series of simple preprocessing steps, including spatial alignment, color normalization, and blood vessels removal. Background noise is regarded as stochastic variable and modeled through Gaussian for normal images and mixture of Gaussian for abnormal images, respectively. The proposed method encodes both the background knowledge of fundus images and the background noise into one unique model, and corporately optimizes the model using normal and abnormal images, which fully depict the low-rank subspace of the background and distinguish the lesions from the background noise in abnormal fundus images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is of fine arts accuracy and outperforms the previous related methods.},

  abstract = {Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a condition that carries a high risk of severe visual impairment. The hallmark of PDR is neovascularisation, the growth of abnormal new vessels. This paper describes an automated method for the detection of new vessels in retinal images. Two vessel segmentation approaches are applied, using the standard line operator and a novel modified line operator. The latter is designed to reduce false responses to non-vessel edges. Both generated binary vessel maps hold vital information which must be processed separately. This is achieved with a dual classification system. Local morphology features are measured from each binary vessel map to produce two separate feature sets. Independent classification is performed for each feature set using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The system then combines these individual classification outcomes to produce a final decision. Sensitivity and specificity results using a dataset of 60 images are 0.862 and 0.944 respectively on a per patch basis and 1.00 and 0.90 respectively on a per image basis.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a performance at the level of dermatologists in the diagnosis of melanoma. Accordingly, further exploring the potential limitations of CNN technology before broadly applying it is of special interest. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between gentian violet surgical skin markings in dermoscopic images and the diagnostic performance of a CNN approved for use as a medical device in the European market. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted from August 1, 2018, to November 30, 2018, using a CNN architecture trained with more than 120 000 dermoscopic images of skin neoplasms and corresponding diagnoses. The association of gentian violet skin markings in dermoscopic images with the performance of the CNN was investigated in 3 image sets of 130 melanocytic lesions each (107 benign nevi, 23 melanomas). EXPOSURES: The same lesions were sequentially imaged with and without the application of a gentian violet surgical skin marker and then evaluated by the CNN for their probability of being a melanoma. In addition, the markings were removed by manually cropping the dermoscopic images to focus on the melanocytic lesion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the CNN's diagnostic classification in unmarked, marked, and cropped images. RESULTS: In all, 130 melanocytic lesions (107 benign nevi and 23 melanomas) were imaged. In unmarked lesions, the CNN achieved a sensitivity of 95.7\% (95\% CI, 79\%-99.2\%) and a specificity of 84.1\% (95\% CI, 76.0\%-89.8\%). The ROC AUC was 0.969. In marked lesions, an increase in melanoma probability scores was observed that resulted in a sensitivity of 100\% (95\% CI, 85.7\%-100\%) and a significantly reduced specificity of 45.8\% (95\% CI, 36.7\%-55.2\%, P\,{$<$}\,.001). The ROC AUC was 0.922. Cropping images led to the highest sensitivity of 100\% (95\% CI, 85.7\%-100\%), specificity of 97.2\% (95\% CI, 92.1\%-99.0\%), and ROC AUC of 0.993. Heat maps created by vanilla gradient descent backpropagation indicated that the blue markings were associated with the increased false-positive rate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that skin markings significantly interfered with the CNN's correct diagnosis of nevi by increasing the melanoma probability scores and consequently the false-positive rate. A predominance of skin markings in melanoma training images may have induced the CNN's association of markings with a melanoma diagnosis. Accordingly, these findings suggest that skin markings should be avoided in dermoscopic images intended for analysis by a CNN.

  abstract = {Background Numerous population-based studies of age-related macular degeneration have been reported around the world, with the results of some studies suggesting racial or ethnic differences in disease prevalence. Integrating these resources to provide summarised data to establish worldwide prevalence and to project the number of people with age-related macular degeneration from 2020 to 2040 would be a useful guide for global strategies. Methods We did a systematic literature review to identify all population-based studies of age-related macular degeneration published before May, 2013. Only studies using retinal photographs and standardised grading classifications (the Wisconsin age-related maculopathy grading system, the international classification for age-related macular degeneration, or the Rotterdam staging system) were included. Hierarchical Bayesian approaches were used to estimate the pooled prevalence, the 95\% credible intervals (CrI), and to examine the difference in prevalence by ethnicity (European, African, Hispanic, Asian) and region (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, and Oceania). UN World Population Prospects were used to project the number of people affected in 2014 and 2040. Bayes factor was calculated as a measure of statistical evidence, with a score above three indicating substantial evidence. Findings Analysis of 129\hphantom{,}664 individuals (aged 30–97 years), with 12\hphantom{,}727 cases from 39 studies, showed the pooled prevalence (mapped to an age range of 45–85 years) of early, late, and any age-related macular degeneration to be 8·01\% (95\% CrI 3·98–15·49), 0·37\% (0·18–0·77), and 8·69\% (4·26–17·40), respectively. We found a higher prevalence of early and any age-related macular degeneration in Europeans than in Asians (early: 11·2\% vs 6·8\%, Bayes factor 3·9; any: 12·3\% vs 7·4\%, Bayes factor 4·3), and early, late, and any age-related macular degeneration to be more prevalent in Europeans than in Africans (early: 11·2\% vs 7·1\%, Bayes factor 12·2; late: 0·5\% vs 0·3\%, 3·7; any: 12·3\% vs 7·5\%, 31·3). There was no difference in prevalence between Asians and Africans (all Bayes factors {$<$}1). Europeans had a higher prevalence of geographic atrophy subtype (1·11\%, 95\% CrI 0·53–2·08) than Africans (0·14\%, 0·04–0·45), Asians (0·21\%, 0·04–0·87), and Hispanics (0·16\%, 0·05–0·46). Between geographical regions, cases of early and any age-related macular degeneration were less prevalent in Asia than in Europe and North America (early: 6·3\% vs 14.3\% and 12·8\% [Bayes factor 2·3 and 7·6]; any: 6·9\% vs 18·3\% and 14·3\% [3·0 and 3·8]). No significant gender effect was noted in prevalence (Bayes factor {$<$}1·0). The projected number of people with age-related macular degeneration in 2020 is 196 million (95\% CrI 140–261), increasing to 288 million in 2040 (205–399). Interpretation These estimates indicate the substantial global burden of age-related macular degeneration. Summarised data provide information for understanding the effect of the condition and provide data towards designing eye-care strategies and health services around the world.

  abstract = {Glaucoma is a leading cause of permanent blindness. However, disease progression can be limited if detected early. The optic cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) is one of the main clinical indicators of glaucoma, and is currently determined manually, limiting its potential in mass screening. In this paper, we propose an automatic CDR determination method using a variational level-set approach to segment the optic disc and cup from retinal fundus images. The method is a core component of ARGALI, a system for automated glaucoma risk assessment. Threshold analysis is used in pre-processing to estimate the initial contour. Due to the presence of retinal vasculature traversing the disc and cup boundaries which can cause inaccuracies in the detected contours, an ellipse-fitting post-processing step is also introduced. The method was tested on 104 images from the Singapore Malay Eye Study, and it was found the results produced a clinically acceptable variation of up to 0.2 CDR units from the manually graded samples, with potential use in mass screening.},

In this paper, we present THALIA, an automatic system for the detection of drusen images for AMD assessment. First, the macular region of interest is detected using a seeded mode tracking approach. The macular region of interest is then mapped into a new representation using a hierarchicial word transform (HWI). In HWI, dense sampling is first carried out to generate structured pixels which embed local context. These structured pixels are then clustered using hierarchical k-means. The HWI image is subsequently classified using a SVM-based classifier. We have tested THALIA on a dataset of 350 images and obtained an accuracy of 95.46\%. Results are promising for further validation of the THALIA system.},

  abstract = {The conventional recipe for maximizing model accuracy is to (1) train multiple models with various hyperparameters and (2) pick the individual model which performs best on a held-out validation set, discarding the remainder. In this paper, we revisit the second step of this procedure in the context of fine-tuning large pre-trained models, where fine-tuned models often appear to lie in a single low error basin. We show that averaging the weights of multiple models finetuned with different hyperparameter configurations often improves accuracy and robustness. Unlike a conventional ensemble, we may average many models without incurring any additional inference or memory costs—we call the results “model soups.” When fine-tuning large pre-trained models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and a ViT-G pretrained on JFT, our soup recipe provides significant improvements over the best model in a hyperparameter sweep on ImageNet. The resulting ViT-G model, which attains 90.94\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, achieved a new state of the art. Furthermore, we show that the model soup approach extends to multiple image classification and natural language processing tasks, improves out-of-distribution performance, and improves zero-shot performance on new downstream tasks. Finally, we analytically relate the performance similarity of weight-averaging and logitensembling to flatness of the loss and confidence of the predictions, and validate this relation empirically.

However, the manual evaluation of the volumetric scan is time consuming, expensive and the signs of the early disease are easy to miss. In this paper, we mainly present an attention-based deep learning method for the retinal disease classification in OCT images, which can assist the large-scale screening or the diagnosis recommendation for an ophthalmologist. First, according to the unique characteristic of a retinal OCT image, we design a customized pre-processing method to improve image quality. Second, in order to guide the network optimization more effectively, a specially designed attention model, which pays more attention to critical regions containing pathological anomalies, is integrated into a typical deep learning network. We evaluate our proposed method on two data sets, and the results consistently show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We report an overall four-class accuracy of 97.4\%, a two-class sensitivity of 100.0\%, and a two-class specificity of 100.0\% on a public data set shared by Zhang et al. with 1,000 testing B-scans in four disease classes.

However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks.

  abstract = {Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID- 19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID- 19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID- 19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts, opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average sensitivity of 95.0\% and a specificity of 93.0\% on the classification test set, and 78.5\% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS dataset.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the domain of natural language processing, Transformers are recognized as state-of-the-art models, which opposing to typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do not rely on convolution layers. Instead, Transformers employ multi-head attention mechanisms as the main building block to capture long-range contextual relations between image pixels. Recently, CNNs dominated the deep learning solutions for diabetic retinopathy grade recognition. However, spurred by the advantages of Transformers, we propose a Transformer-based method that is appropriate for recognizing the grade of diabetic retinopathy. PURPOSE: The purposes of this work are to demonstrate that (i) the pure attention mechanism is suitable for diabetic retinopathy grade recognition and (ii) Transformers can replace traditional CNNs for diabetic retinopathy grade recognition. METHODS: This paper proposes a Vision Transformer-based method to recognize the grade of diabetic retinopathy. Fundus images are subdivided into non-overlapping patches, which are then converted into sequences by flattening, and undergo a linear and positional embedding process to preserve positional information. Then, the generated sequence is input into several multi-head attention layers to generate the final representation. The first token sequence is input to a softmax classification layer to produce the recognition output in the classification stage. RESULTS: The dataset for training and testing employs fundus images of different resolutions, subdivided into patches. We challenge our method against current CNNs and extreme learning machines and achieve an appealing performance. Specifically, the suggested deep learning architecture attains an accuracy of 91.4\%, specificity~=~0.977 (95\% confidence interval (CI) (0.951-1)), precision~=~0.928 (95\% CI (0.852-1)), sensitivity~=~0.926 (95\% CI (0.863-0.989)), quadratic weighted kappa score~=~0.935, and area under curve (AUC)~=~0.986. CONCLUSION: Our comparative experiments against current methods conclude that our model is competitive and highlight that an attention mechanism based on a Vision Transformer model is promising for the diabetic retinopathy grade recognition task.},

SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3\% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5× smaller and 2.2\% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0\% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C. Code is available at: github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer.},

In this paper, we provide several mathematical results needed for studying the linear regions of CNNs, and use them to derive the maximal and average numbers of linear regions for one-layer ReLU CNNs. Furthermore, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the number of linear regions of multi-layer ReLU CNNs.

  abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy is one of the main causes of blindness in human eyes, and lesion segmentation is an important basic work for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Due to the small lesion areas scattered in fundus images, it is laborious to segment the lesion of diabetic retinopathy effectively with the existing U-Net model. In this paper, we proposed a new lesion segmentation model named FFU-Net (Feature Fusion U-Net) that enhances U-Net from the following points. Firstly, the pooling layer in the network is replaced with a convolutional layer to reduce spatial loss of the fundus image. Then, we integrate multiscale feature fusion (MSFF) block into the encoders which helps the network to learn multiscale features efficiently and enrich the information carried with skip connection and lower-resolution decoder by fusing contextual channel attention (CCA) models. Finally, in order to solve the problems of data imbalance and misclassification, we present a Balanced Focal Loss function. In the experiments on benchmark dataset IDRID, we make an ablation study to verify the effectiveness of each component and compare FFU-Net against several state-of-the-art models. In comparison with baseline U-Net, FFU-Net improves the segmentation performance by 11.97\%, 10.68\%, and 5.79\% on metrics SEN, IOU, and DICE, respectively. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our FFU-Net in the task of lesion segmentation of diabetic retinopathy.},

GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the WeisfeilerLehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Without sufficient high-quality annotations, the usual data-driven learning-based approaches struggle with deficient training. On the other hand, directly introducing additional data with low-quality annotations may confuse the network, leading to undesirable performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel mean-teacher-assisted confident learning framework to robustly exploit the noisy labeled data for the challenging hepatic vessel segmentation task. Specifically, with the adapted confident learning assisted by a third party, i.e., the weight-averaged teacher model, the noisy labels in the additional low-quality dataset can be transformed from ‘encumbrance’ to ‘treasure’ via progressive pixel-wise soft-correction, thus providing productive guidance. Extensive experiments using two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component.},

  abstract = {Manually segmenting the hepatic vessels from Computer Tomography (CT) is far more expertise-demanding and laborious than other structures due to the low-contrast and complex morphology of vessels, resulting in the extreme lack of high-quality labeled data. Without sufficient high-quality annotations, the usual data-driven learning-based approaches struggle with deficient training. On the other hand, directly introducing additional data with low-quality annotations may confuse the network, leading to undesirable performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel mean-teacher-assisted confident learning framework to robustly exploit the noisy labeled data for the challenging hepatic vessel segmentation task. Specifically, with the adapted confident learning assisted by a third party, i.e., the weight-averaged teacher model, the noisy labels in the additional low-quality dataset can be transformed from ‘encumbrance’ to ‘treasure’ via progressive pixel-wise soft-correction, thus providing productive guidance. Extensive experiments using two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component.},

This paper presents an automated multimodal and temporal retinal image registration method which is especially robust to infrared radiation (IR) fundus images, which may suffer terrible imaging artifacts, such as extremely low contrast, overexposed edges, or invisibility of blood vessels. The method we propose combines the feature-based registration method and the statistics-based registration method by using the OD detection method based on Line operator to detect the OD for the fundamental registration and use the maximal mutual information method for fine registration and improve them by down-sampling, getting Region of Interest (ROI), bilateral filter and so on to get a better effect. Experiments over optical coherence tomography (OCT) and IR dataset show that our proposed method outperforms other methods by obtaining an accuracy of 82\% and an average time consuming of 5.1 second.},

It is not only useful for clinicians in the evaluation of the condition of the optic disc, but it also simplifies the pathological diagnosis and disease progression monitoring. This paper describes a complete 3‐D optic disc reconstruction method from a pair of stereo images by a series of robust procedures including camera calibration, image registration, depth recovery, and ocular media optical inclusion. Methods Two registration techniques (correlation and feature based methods) are combined together to prune the uncertain matching points in order to improve the overall accuracy of registration. The ocular media within the eyeball are lump modelled as a single lens and integrated into the reconstruction process to obtain an accurate 3‐D optic disc image. Conclusion The recovered 3‐D optic disc images show good consistency and compatibility when compared with the results from Heidelberg retina tomography (HRT) under clinical validation, with an additional advantage of implementing a more economical and conventional mode of retinal image acquisition.},

In addition to predicting the change in the maximum wind (Vmax) as in the original SHIPS technique, another version of SHIPS for predicting the change in the minimum sea-level pressure (Pmin) has been developed. With 13 years of training samples, a total of 26 predictors were selected from among 52 through stepwise regression. Based on three years of independent samples, the root mean square errors of both Vmax and Pmin by the 26-predictor SHIPS model were found to be much smaller than those of the JMA/GSM and a simple climatology and persistence intensity model, which JMA official intensity forecasts are currently mainly based on. The prediction accuracy was not sensitive to the number of predictors as long as the leading predictors were included. Benefits of operationalizing SHIPS include a reduction in the errors of the JMA official intensity forecasts and an extension of their forecast length beyond the current 3 days (e.g., 5 days).},

However, the fundus image dataset is relatively small, which makes the pure transformer model challenging to be applied to medical disease analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a Transformer Eye (TransEye) fine-grained fundus disease image classification method based on the self-attention mechanism to assist diagnosis. TransEye combines the advantages of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer model. It can not only effectively extract the underlying features, but also establish the remote dependence of the image. So, it can locate the most discriminative image area and complete end-to-end training. Evaluated the classification effect of our method on the preprocessed OIA dataset, the experimental results show the superiority of TransEye.},

  abstract = {We study on image super-resolution (SR), which aims to recover realistic textures from a low-resolution (LR) image. Recent progress has been made by taking high-resolution images as references (Ref), so that relevant textures can be transferred to LR images. However, existing SR approaches neglect to use attention mechanisms to transfer high-resolution (HR) textures from Ref images, which limits these approaches in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose a novel Texture Transformer Network for Image Super-Resolution (TTSR), in which the LR and Ref images are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer, respectively. TTSR consists of four closely-related modules optimized for image generation tasks, including a learnable texture extractor by DNN, a relevance embedding module, a hard-attention module for texture transfer, and a softattention module for texture synthesis. Such a design encourages joint feature learning across LR and Ref images, in which deep feature correspondences can be discovered by attention, and thus accurate texture features can be transferred. The proposed texture transformer can be further stacked in a cross-scale way, which enables texture recovery from different levels (e.g., from 1× to 4× magnification). Extensive experiments show that TTSR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the current state of research in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). SDOCT is an interferometric technique that provides depth-resolved tissue structure information encoded in the magnitude and delay of the back-scattered light by spectral analysis of the interference fringe pattern. There are two approaches to SDOCT—one that uses a broadband source and a spectrometer to measure the interference pattern as a function of wavelength and the other that utilizes a narrowband tunable laser that is swept linearly in k ∼ 1/λ space during spectral fringe data acquisition. Unlike time domain (TD) OCT, the reference arm is stationary in both SDOCT methods, which allows for ultra high-speed OCT imaging. Owing to its high speed and superior sensitivity, SDOCT has become indispensable in biomedical imaging applications. After a brief introduction and a discussion on sensitivity advantage, methods of implementation of the two SDOCT schemes will be presented. The two peer approaches are compared in speed, scan depth range, complexity, spectral regions of operation, and methods of detection. The review also discusses OCT enhancements and functional methods based on SDOCT format and concludes with possible directions that this research may take in the near future.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses semi-supervised semantic segmentation by exploiting a small set of images with pixel-level annotations (strong supervisions) and a large set of images with only image-level annotations (weak supervisions). Most existing approaches aim to generate accurate pixel-level labels from weak supervisions. However, we observe that those generated labels still inevitably contain noisy labels. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel perspective and formulate this task as a problem of learning with pixel-level label noise. Existing noisy label methods, nevertheless, mainly aim at image-level tasks, which can not capture the relationship between neighboring labels in one image. Therefore, we propose a graph-based label noise detection and correction framework to deal with pixel-level noisy labels. In particular, for the generated pixel-level noisy labels from weak supervisions by Class Activation Map (CAM), we train a clean segmentation model with strong supervisions to detect the clean labels from these noisy labels according to the cross-entropy loss. Then, we adopt a superpixel-based graph to represent the relations of spatial adjacency and semantic similarity between pixels in one image. Finally we correct the noisy labels using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supervised by detected clean labels. We comprehensively conduct experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context, MS-COCO and Cityscapes datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed semi-supervised method achieves the state-of-the-art performances and even outperforms the fully-supervised models on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets in some cases.},

Here, we demonstrate that few-shot learning (FSL) using a generative adversarial network (GAN) can improve the applicability of DL in the optical coherence tomography (OCT) diagnosis of rare diseases. Four major classes with a large number of datasets and five rare disease classes with a few-shot dataset are included in this study. Before training the classifier, we constructed GAN models to generate pathological OCT images of each rare disease from normal OCT images. The Inception-v3 architecture was trained using an augmented training dataset, and the final model was validated using an independent test dataset. The synthetic images helped in the extraction of the characteristic features of each rare disease. The proposed DL model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the OCT diagnosis of rare retinal diseases and outperformed the traditional DL models, Siamese network, and prototypical network. By increasing the accuracy of diagnosing rare retinal diseases through FSL, clinicians can avoid neglecting rare diseases with DL assistance, thereby reducing diagnosis delay and patient burden.},

  abstract = {Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently, e.g., the Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance compared with CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset (e.g., ImageNet). We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure (e.g., edges, lines) among neighboring pixels, leading to its low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness in fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformers (T2T-ViT), which introduces 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure presented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformers motivated by CNN architecture design after extensive study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter counts and MACs of vanilla ViT by 200\textbackslash\%, while achieving more than 2.5\textbackslash\% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets when directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with ResNet50 comparable size can achieve 80.7\textbackslash\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. (Code: https://github.com/yitu-opensource/T2T-ViT)},

  abstract = {Transformers with powerful global relation modeling abilities have been introduced to fundamental computer vision tasks recently. As a typical example, the Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture on image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed length, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens. However, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids to uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals. To mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and progressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each iteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer encoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the sampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is differentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT network can adaptively learn where to look. The proposed PS-ViT is both effective and efficient. When trained from scratch on ImageNet, PS-ViT performs 3.8\% higher than the vanilla ViT in terms of top-1 accuracy with about 4× fewer parameters and 10× fewer FLOPs.

However, as the proper training of Transformer generally requires an extremely large quantity of data, it has rarely been explored for the medical imaging tasks. In this paper, we attempt to adopt the Vision Transformer for the retinal disease classification tasks, by pre-training the Transformer model on a large fundus image database and then fine-tuning on downstream retinal disease classification tasks. In addition, to fully exploit the feature representations extracted by individual image patches, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) based ‘MIL head’, which can be conveniently attached to the Vision Transformer in a plug-and-play manner and effectively enhances the model performance for the downstream fundus image classification tasks. The proposed MIL-VT framework achieves superior performance over CNN models on two publicly available datasets when being trained and tested under the same setup.

It is now an essential tool for evaluating age related macular degeneration, macular dystrophies, retinitis pigmentosa, white dot syndromes, retinal drug toxicities, and various other retinal disorders. FAF may detect abnormalities beyond those detected on funduscopic exam, fluorescein angiography, or optical coherence tomography, and can be used to elucidate disease pathogenesis, form genotype-phenotype correlations, diagnose and monitor disease, and evaluate novel therapies. Given its ease of use, non-invasive nature, and value in characterizing retinal disease, FAF enjoys increasing clinical relevance. This review summarizes common ocular fluorophores, imaging modalities, and FAF findings for a wide spectrum of retinal disorders.},

Temporal registration is necessary in order to follow the various steps of a disease, whereas multimodal registration allows us to improve the identification of some lesions or to compare pieces of information gathered from different sources. This paper presents an algorithm for temporal and/or multimodal registration of retinal images based on point correspondence. As an example, the algorithm has been applied to the registration of fluorescein images (obtained after a fluorescein dye injection) with green images (green filter of a color image). The vascular tree is first detected in each type of images and bifurcation points are labeled with surrounding vessel orientations. An angle-based invariant is then computed in order to give a probability for two points to match. Then a Bayesian Hough transform is used to sort the transformations with their respective likelihoods. A precise affine estimate is finally computed for most likely transformations. The best transformation is chosen for registration.},

However, automated, complete DR classification frameworks based on both OCT and OCTA data have not been proposed. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method is proposed to fulfill a DR classification framework using en face OCT and OCTA. Methods: A densely and continuously connected neural network with adaptive rate dropout (DcardNet) is designed for the DR classification. In addition, adaptive label smoothing was proposed and used to suppress overfitting. Three separate classification levels are generated for each case based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale. At the highest level the network classifies scans as referable or non-referable for DR. The second level classifies the eye as non-DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), or proliferative DR (PDR). The last level classifies the case as no DR, mild and moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and PDR. Results: We used 10-fold cross-validation with 10\% of the data to assess the network's performance. The overall classification accuracies of the three levels were 95.7\%, 85.0\%, and 71.0\% respectively. Conclusion/Significance: A reliable, sensitive and specific automated classification framework for referral to an ophthalmologist can be a key technology for reducing vision loss related to DR.},

However, if the training data are corrupted by noisy labels, the resulting performance might be deteriorated. In the domain of medical image analysis, this dilemma becomes extremely severe. This is because the medical image annotation always requires medical expertise and clinical experience, which would inevitably introduce subjectivity. In this paper, we design a novel algorithm based on the teacher-student architecture for noisy-labeled medical image segmentation. Creatively, We introduce confident learning (CL) method to identify the corrupted labels and endow CNN an anti-interference ability to the noises. Specifically, the CL technique is introduced to the teacher model to characterize the suspected wrong-labeled pixels. Since the noise identification maps are a little away from sufficient precision, the spatial label smoothing regularization technique is utilized to generate soft-corrected masks for training the student model. Since our method identifies and revises the noisy labels of the training data in a pixel-level rather than simply assigns lower weights to the noisy masks, it outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the noisy-labeled image segmentation task on the JSRT dataset, especially when the training data are severely corrupted by noises.},

For the spherical domain, several methods recently adopt an icosahedron mesh, but systems are typically rotation invariant or require significant memory and parameters, thus enabling execution only at very low resolutions. In our work, we propose an orientation-aware CNN framework for the icosahedron mesh. Our representation allows for fast network operations, as our design simplifies to standard network operations of classical CNNs, but under consideration of north-aligned kernel convolutions for features on the sphere. We implement our representation and demonstrate its memory efficiency up-to a level-8 resolution mesh (equivalent to 640×1024 equirectangular images). Finally, since our kernels operate on the tangent of the sphere, standard feature weights, pretrained on perspective data, can be directly transferred with only small need for weight refinement. In our evaluation our orientation-aware CNN becomes a new state of the art for the recent 2D3DS dataset, and our Omni-SYNTHIA version of SYNTHIA. Rotation invariant classification and segmentation tasks are additionally presented for comparison to prior art.},

  abstract = {Medical image segmentation - the prerequisite of numerous clinical needs - has been significantly prospered by recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it exhibits general limitations on modeling explicit long-range relation, and existing cures, resorting to building deep encoders along with aggressive downsampling operations, leads to redundant deepened networks and loss of localized details. Hence, the segmentation task awaits a better solution to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts while maintaining a strong grasp of low-level details. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel-in-branch architecture, TransFuse, to address this challenge. TransFuse combines Transformers and CNNs in a parallel style, where both global dependency and low-level spatial details can be efficiently captured in a much shallower manner. Besides, a novel fusion technique - BiFusion module is created to efficiently fuse the multi-level features from both branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransFuse achieves the newest state-of-the-art results on both 2D and 3D medical image sets including polyp, skin lesion, hip, and prostate segmentation, with significant parameter decrease and inference speed improvement.},

  abstract = {Collecting labeled data for the task of semantic segmentation is expensive and time-consuming, as it requires dense pixel-level annotations. While recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic segmentation approaches have achieved impressive results by using large amounts of labeled training data, their performance drops significantly as the amount of labeled data decreases. This happens because deep CNNs trained with the de facto cross-entropy loss can easily overfit to small amounts of labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective contrastive learning-based training strategy in which we first pretrain the network using a pixel-wise, label-based contrastive loss, and then fine-tune it using the cross-entropy loss. This approach increases intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby resulting in a better pixel classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy using the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation datasets. Our results show that pretraining with the proposed contrastive loss results in large performance gains (more than 20\% absolute improvement in some settings) when the amount of labeled data is limited. In many settings, the proposed contrastive pretraining strategy, which does not use any additional data, is able to match or outperform the widely-used ImageNet pretraining strategy that uses more than a million additional labeled images.},

Most of the current deep learning methods focus on single-tool detection and suffer from low detection speed. To address this, the authors propose a novel frame-by-frame detection method using a cascading convolutional neural network (CNN) which consists of two different CNNs for real-time multi-tool detection. An hourglass network and a modified visual geometry group (VGG) network are applied to jointly predict the localisation. The former CNN outputs detection heatmaps representing the location of tool tip areas, and the latter performs bounding-box regression for tool tip areas on these heatmaps stacked with input RGB image frames. The authors’ method is tested on the publicly available EndoVis Challenge dataset and the ATLAS Dione dataset. The experimental results show that their method achieves better performance than mainstream detection methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed.},

However, due to the strict pixel-level constraint, it cannot perform shape changes, remove large objects, or ignore irrelevant texture. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarialconsistency loss for image-to-image translation. This loss does not require the translated image to be translated back to be a specific source image but can encourage the translated images to retain important features of the source images and overcome the drawbacks of cycle-consistency loss noted above. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging tasks: glasses removal, male-to-female translation, and selfieto-anime translation.},

  abstract = {Purpose:~         To develop and test semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) that detect retinal disorders on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using a small-labeled dataset.         Methods:~         From a public database, we randomly chose a small supervised dataset with 400 OCT images (100 choroidal neovascularization, 100 diabetic macular edema, 100 drusen, and 100 normal) and assigned all other OCT images to unsupervised dataset (107,912 images without labeling). We adopted a semi-supervised GAN and a supervised deep learning (DL) model for automatically detecting retinal disorders from OCT images. The performance of the 2 models was compared in 3 testing datasets with different OCT devices. The evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves.         Results:~         The local validation dataset included 1000 images with 250 from each category. The independent clinical dataset included 366 OCT images using Cirrus OCT Shanghai Shibei Hospital and 511 OCT images using RTVue OCT from Xinhua Hospital respectively. The semi-supervised GANs classifier achieved better accuracy than supervised DL model (0.91 vs 0.86 for local cell validation dataset, 0.91 vs 0.86 in the Shanghai Shibei Hospital testing dataset, and 0.93 vs 0.92 in Xinhua Hospital testing dataset). For detecting urgent referrals (choroidal neo-vascularization and diabetic macular edema) from nonurgent referrals (drusen and normal) on OCT images, the semi-supervised GANs classifier also achieved better area under the receiver operating characteristic curves than supervised DL model (0.99 vs 0.97, 0.97 vs 0.96, and 0.99 vs 0.99, respectively).         Conclusions:~         A semi-supervised GAN can achieve better performance than that of a supervised DL model when the labeled dataset is limited. The current study offers utility to various research and clinical studies using DL with relatively small datasets. Semi-supervised GANs can detect retinal disorders from OCT images using relatively small dataset.},

Existing approaches focus on minoring the inter-domain gap between the source and target domains. However, the intra-domain knowledge and inherent uncertainty learned by the network are under-explored. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal method, called memory regularization in vivo, to exploit the intradomain knowledge and regularize the model training. Specifically, we refer to the segmentation model itself as the memory module, and minor the discrepancy of the two classifiers, i.e., the primary classifier and the auxiliary classifier, to reduce the prediction inconsistency. Without extra parameters, the proposed method is complementary to most existing domain adaptation methods and could generally improve the performance of existing methods. Albeit simple, we verify the effectiveness of memory regularization on two synthetic-to-real benchmarks: GTA5 → Cityscapes and SYNTHIA → Cityscapes, yielding +11.1\% and +11.3\% mIoU improvement over the baseline model, respectively. Besides, a similar +12.0\% mIoU improvement is observed on the cross-city benchmark: Cityscapes → Oxford RobotCar.},

  abstract = {People with diabetes are at risk of developing an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy (DR). This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis has become a promising tool for the early detection and severity grading of DR, due to the great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset containing 2,842 images (FGADR). Specifically, this dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. Further, we establish three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2. DR grading by joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer learning for ocular multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive transfer learning method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, which can serve as baselines for future research. Our dataset will be released in https://csyizhou.github.io/FGADR/.},

  abstract = {Medical image analysis has two important research areas: disease grading and fine-grained lesion segmentation. Although the former problem often relies on the latter, the two are usually studied separately. Disease severity grading can be treated as a classification problem, which only requires image-level annotations, while the lesion segmentation requires stronger pixel-level annotations. However, pixel-wise data annotation for medical images is highly time-consuming and requires domain experts. In this paper, we propose a collaborative learning method to jointly improve the performance of disease grading and lesion segmentation by semi-supervised learning with an attention mechanism. Given a small set of pixel-level annotated data, a multi-lesion mask generation model first performs the traditional semantic segmentation task. Then, based on initially predicted lesion maps for large quantities of imagelevel annotated data, a lesion attentive disease grading model is designed to improve the severity classification accuracy. Meanwhile, the lesion attention model can refine the lesion maps using class-specific information to fine-tune the segmentation model in a semi-supervised manner. An adversarial architecture is also integrated for training. With extensive experiments on a representative medical problem called diabetic retinopathy (DR), we validate the effectiveness of our method and achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets.},

  abstract = {Dense video captioning aims to generate text descriptions for all events in an untrimmed video. This involves both detecting and describing events. Therefore, all previous methods on dense video captioning tackle this problem by building two models, i.e. an event proposal and a captioning model, for these two sub-problems. The models are either trained separately or in alternation. This prevents direct influence of the language description to the event proposal, which is important for generating accurate descriptions. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end transformer model for dense video captioning. The encoder encodes the video into appropriate representations. The proposal decoder decodes from the encoding with different anchors to form video event proposals. The captioning decoder employs a masking network to restrict its attention to the proposal event over the encoding feature. This masking network converts the event proposal to a differentiable mask, which ensures the consistency between the proposal and captioning during training. In addition, our model employs a self-attention mechanism, which enables the use of efficient non-recurrent structure during encoding and leads to performance improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this end-to-end model on ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII datasets, where we achieved 10.12 and 6.58 METEOR score, respectively.},

Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1\% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation.

Our architecture is essentially a deeply-supervised encoder-decoder network where the encoder and decoder sub-networks are connected through a series of nested, dense skip pathways. The re-designed skip pathways aim at reducing the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. We argue that the optimizer would deal with an easier learning task when the feature maps from the decoder and encoder networks are semantically similar. We have evaluated UNet++ in comparison with U-Net and wide U-Net architectures across multiple medical image segmentation tasks: nodule segmentation in the low-dose CT scans of chest, nuclei segmentation in the microscopy images, liver segmentation in abdominal CT scans, and polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos. Our experiments demonstrate that UNet++ with deep supervision achieves an average IoU gain of 3.9 and 3.4 points over U-Net and wide U-Net, respectively.},

  abstract = {The state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation are variants of U-Net and fully convolutional networks (FCN). Despite their success, these models have two limitations: (1) their optimal depth is apriori unknown, requiring extensive architecture search or inefficient ensemble of models of varying depths; and (2) their skip connections impose an unnecessarily restrictive fusion scheme, forcing aggregation only at the same-scale feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. To overcome these two limitations, we propose UNet++, a new neural architecture for semantic and instance segmentation, by (1) alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; (2) redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; and (3) devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++. We have evaluated UNet++ using six different medical image segmentation datasets, covering multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM), and demonstrating that (1) UNet++ consistently outperforms the baseline models for the task of semantic segmentation across different datasets and backbone architectures; (2) UNet++ enhances segmentation quality of varying-size objects—an improvement over the fixed-depth UNet; (3) Mask RCNN++ (Mask R-CNN with UNet++ design) outperforms the original Mask R-CNN for the task of instance segmentation; and (4) pruned UNet++ models achieve significant speedup while showing only modest performance degradation. Our implementation and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/UNetPlusPlus.},

Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.

  abstract = {Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on highresolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-ofthe-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset.

  abstract = {Deep learning methods have achieved promising performance in many areas, but they are still struggling with noisy-labeled images during the training process. Considering that the annotation quality indispensably relies on great expertise, the problem is even more crucial in the medical image domain. How to eliminate the disturbance from noisy labels for segmentation tasks without further annotations is still a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce our label quality evaluation strategy for deep neural networks automatically assessing the quality of each label, which is not explicitly provided, and training on clean-annotated ones. We propose a solution for network automatically evaluating the relative quality of the labels in the training set and using good ones to tune the network parameters. We also design an overfitting control module to let the network maximally learn from the precise annotations during the training process. Experiments on the public biomedical image segmentation dataset have proved the method outperforms baseline methods and retains both high accuracy and good generalization at different noise levels.},

Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

  abstract = {Recent deep networks achieved state of the art performance on a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. Despite such progress, these models often face challenges in real world “wild tasks” where large difference between labeled training/source data and unseen test/target data exists. In particular, such difference is often referred to as “domain gap”, and could cause significantly decreased performance which cannot be easily remedied by further increasing the representation power. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to overcome such problem without target domain labels. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA framework based on an iterative self-training (ST) procedure, where the problem is formulated as latent variable loss minimization, and can be solved by alternatively generating pseudo labels on target data and re-training the model with these labels. On top of ST, we also propose a novel classbalanced self-training (CBST) framework to avoid the gradual dominance of large classes on pseudo-label generation, and introduce spatial priors to refine generated labels. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state of the art semantic segmentation performance under multiple major UDA settings.},
